    <h4>HIGH VIBE LIVING COURSE</h4>

    <p>High Vibe Living is what it’s all about. Holding a high vibration is the basis of manifesting
    what you want in life. When you feel good, you are a magnet for good. This course will
    give you many tips along with energy healings and meditations to release the lower
    energies that hold you back and prevent you from truly living your HIGH VIBE life!</p>

    <p>Below you will find my TOP TIPS that help me to move out of a lower vibration and
    begin to feel myself again. These tips always work to uplift my mood and to NOT allow
    things outside of me to pull me down.</p>

    <p>I created this course after a very rollercoaster of a year while I was dealing with the loss
    of my Sister. Her passing really shook my world. I didn’t know what was what. I totally
    lost myself. The tips I share in this course is what kept me sane and able to shift back
    into my usual HIGH VIBE self.</p>

    <h6>Start right now to pay attention and be aware of your own vibration.</h6>

    <p>You have the power to maintain a high vibration. There will always be times when your
    energy dips. There will always be experience that pulls you out of your High Vibe, but
    with all the tips, healing sessions and meditations shared here, you can more easily
    return back to that high vibration where all of your dreams and desires can manifest.</p>

    <p>Work with the following energy clearings and meditations as much as you like. You will
    find that you have a new experience every time listen.</p>

    <p>Peace, Love &amp; Light,</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>Energy Clearings</h4>
    <p>In this module we get into actually clearing common blocks that prevent you from
    staying in a HIGH VIBRATION and release subconscious programming that trigger you
    to fall into a LOW VIBRATION.</p>
    <p>I recommend you block out a half hour of uninterrupted time for Part 1 and again for
    Part 2. You will want to be sitting in a comfortable chair that allows you to rest your
    head. You may also lie down to listen. I prefer that you sit instead of lie down as it will
    help you to be more present for the healing. Lying down is fine, but it will be easier to fall
    asleep.</p>
    <p>Many times during these sessions whether sitting or lying down you will feel yourself
    drift off as if you are floating. This is very good as you are being taken into that bigger
    energy field that is you and beyond. Sort of like a blending with the Universe.</p>
    <p>These Healing Sessions are not a meditation although it may feel like it is. Be sure to
    listen to the intro as I will explain more of what you might experience.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>Bonus Clearing</h4>
    <p>Ok, so here I have a bonus for you. I have created a recording of a statement that you
    can use again and again to clear energy at any time you want. Each time you listen to
    this recording you will place a new NAME or EXPERIENCE in the pause or the blank
    quiet space.</p>
    <p>This will be a general release of energy ties to people in your life, OR experience you
    have had. Experiences that you feel you have negative energy attached.</p>
    <p>FOR EXAMPLE: the accident I had, an illness, an argument, being fired from a job,
    giving birth if it was traumatic, my college years, etc, etc, etc, really any negative
    experience.</p>
    <p>Also, it is a good idea to release energy ties to each member of your family, remember,
    the ties that are cleared are only those that are not for your highest good. I do this
    periodically with my Husband and Son, as well as my parents
    and siblings and others who are really close to me. It just keeps the energy clear and
    open.</p>
    <p>It is important and oh so freeing to release energy ties especially to the people you love.
    It’s important to remember that as we release these ties we are only releasing the ties
    that are not for your highest good. All the good stuff remains.</p>
    <p>Know too that even in what we label “bad experience” there may have been something
    within it that actually was for your highest good to assist you in your growth and
    expansion.</p>
    <p>In this recording I will recite the clearing statement for you to follow along. I will add a
    pause for you to add in your person’s name or experience you want to clear. I will loop
    this statement 3 times. So have 3 things set to clear each time you listen.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h5>Energy Clearing BONUS</h5>

    <h4>Hypnosis Tracks</h4>
    <p>Reprogram your Subconscious Mind to RAISE your vibration with repeat use of these
    recordings.</p>
    <p>Since a belief is just a thought you keep thinking, by listening to these new beliefs
    repeatedly they will be programmed into your subconscious mind. You will be rewriting
    the script, creating new ways of being that assist you to live in a high vibration.</p>
    <p>There are two versions for each of these Hypnosis Tracks. One with Brain Entrainment*
    technology and one without. Both are beautiful and both work to create the new
    beliefs. Be sure to use earbuds or headphones when listening. To get the full benefits of
    the Brain Entrainment* music you need to use your headphones. Plus, even the RAW
    recordings are enhanced with headphones.</p>
    <p>The best times to listen are first thing in the morning and last thing before sleep. The
    more you listen the better. With repeat use you will start to notice shifts in your
    everyday.</p>

    <hr id="meditations">
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>Meditations</h4>
    <p>These great meditations will assist you in holding the focus of your desires and clearing
    out the energy that is standing in your way. They work great together and seperately.</p>
    <p>Be sure to use earbuds or headphones when listening. To get the full benefits of the 
    Brain Entrainment* music you need to use your headphones. Plus, even the RAW recordings 
    are enhanced with headphones.</p>
    <p>The <span class="callouts">DESIRE FOCUS</span> meditation is great as it will give you focus as well as clear away
    energetic blocks while receiving healing. Plus, you will be working with a Majestic Eagle
    and feel so free and energized. Use this repeatedly for all of your goals and desires.
    Use it when you are loosing inspiration. Use it when you are excited about a new desire.
    There are no limits and no rules.</p>
    <p>The <span class="callouts">SUB-PERSONALITY REBOOT</span> is an extreemly healing meditation that has you call
    up a part of yourself that is holding you back operating on old programs that no longer
    serve you. You will heal this part of yourself and give it a new job to do for you that will
    assist you in creating your desires.</p>
    <p>Each time you listen to this meditation you will have a new and different
    experience. The best time to use this meditation is when you are in a lower vibration,
    when something has thrown you off and you are feeling stuck, blocked or in some sort
    of emotional upset. This is the best time to work with this sub-personality meditation as
    it helps you to uncover what is holding you back and then to heal and reprogram.</p>
    <p>And the <span class="callouts">HEAVEN &amp; EARTH GROUNDING (raw)</span> is a great way to start your day. After
    you listen to this even just once you can replicate it for yourself and do this while taking
    a shower. It really feels good to bring in the Heaven and Earth energies as the water of
    the shower assists you in moving your energy.</p>
    <p>Each of these meditations are awesome! They have been recorded with both versions,
    RAW and BRAIN ENTRAINMENT* music.</p>

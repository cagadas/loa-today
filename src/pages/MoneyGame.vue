      <h5 class="header">INTRODUCTION</h5>
      <p>In this book, I talk about creating financial abundance. My mission has not changed at its core since I first was struck with the full vision during a meditation in the New Mexico mountains. I have been asked about this from time to time, given that my first book was NOT the Dreamer&rsquo;s Manifesto, wherein I share the vision of what it means to &ldquo;Dream With Your Eyes Open&rdquo;. My first book, &ldquo;From Time to Time&rdquo; was all about time Mastery and here, in this book, I talk about creating financial abundance.</p>
      <p>The points of pain that hold people back from their Dream have become 'screamingly' clear as I have connected with thousands of people over the last couple of years. The two that often sit at the top are time and money.</p>
      <p>A lot of sub-stories sit under those, but following a little examination, a lot of the time the people I have ended up working with have fallen into one of these two. It was from this space that I wrote &ldquo;From Time to Time&rdquo;, started Micro2Millions and now offer this brief treatise on how to sidestep the story of lack that is holding back so many people.</p>
      <p>When the first of the members of the beta test of my Micro2Millions  group program started manifesting hundreds and then thousands of dollars I was oddly shocked at first.</p>
      <div class="pull-quote">This Money Blueprint got my business to 6 figures in less than 6 months</div>
      <p>Yes, I had given them a blueprint to follow which had not only made me tens of thousands by that time which I had not expected, and had even formed the basis of my building a six-figure coaching business in less than 6months, but seeing these results show up and documented by people from all over the world was still, well, just something else.</p>
      <p>Even though I had detailed, literally step by step how to create the results that the were showing up, it still wasn&rsquo;t universal at first. In fact, a good number of people &ndash; some admittedly not doing to the work for whatever reason &ndash; were not getting the results of others.</p>
      <p>Shocking too was the fact that even seeing the results of their peers, some let the very low investment in the program hold them back from staying the course and going all the way with <i>Micro2Millions</i>. I am therefore very pleased that the clarity came on a coherent message to convey in written form so that money might not be the excuse again for not taking up the offer to walk a proven road to free yourself from lack in the realm of money.</p>

      <h5 class="header">IN THIS BOOK</h5>
      <p>I am going to do my best to outline the optimal way to create not only abundance with ease and grace, but through this medium, anything that you desire.</p>
      <p id="dan">I invite you to sign up for my newsletter over at <a href="#dan" @click="myLink('http://www.dreamwithdan.com/')">www.dreamwithdan.com</a>. I plan to launch another Micro2Millions group and the limited slots will go fast (the original 20 places in the beta group were gone in less than 24 hours).</p>
      <p>I will not be talking around the topic in this book, in order to lure you into some high-priced program. Nor will I seek to tempt you into another high-priced mastermind, offering to teach you how to create this money by selling some widget or other.</p>
      <p>In this book I will give you the exact blueprint that my clients pay thousands of dollars to learn from me in person. So without further a do, I will begin with the story of where it all started.</p>

      <h5 class="header">NEW YORK, NY</h5>
      <p>The origins of this method go back to a book by my dear friend Tim Shields entitled &ldquo;A Curious Year in the Great Vivarium experiment&rdquo;. In the book (which I highly recommend) our protagonist, Thomas, keeps a journal in which everyday he writes down five things that he is grateful for and five intentions that he has.</p>
      <p>In the spirit of micro-shifting &ndash; my principal that we are all capable of making baby steps in the direction of an outcome we would like to create &ndash; I have tended to stick to one thing at a time to create, but he honoured Thomas&rsquo; tradition of writing down five things that I am grateful for.</p>
      <p>Around the summer of 2018, as I begun my journey into fully surrendering to the process of becoming a teacher, going on the road to speak and connect in acts of service, I played with the idea of creating sums of money using this model.</p>
      <div class="pull-quote">Micro-shifting principle got me an unexpected $200 within 48 hours of setting up the intention</div>
      <p>I started with $50, and within 48 hours received just under $200 dollars in crypto currency that I had not been expecting. I went on over the coming months to refine the process through the process of trial and error until today, I am able to call in thousands at a time that comes in the most weird and wacky ways.</p>
      <p>The current format which my clients now use to create: money, clients for their business, free tickets, coupons, art work and even new relationships, was first openly discussed outside of Micro2Millions at one of my intimate, high level mastermind events. As I am known to do at these things, I went with the call to give even more value to the 9.5 hours of raw, life changing content that the attendees received and shared the game with them.</p>
      <p>After months of case studies, testimonials and trial by fire, I now bring this powerful tool to you, so that you too can enjoy the benefits of developing a new paradigm of creative power into your experience.</p>
      <hr id="work" />
      <p><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></p>
      <h5 class="header">INNER WORK AND OUTER WORK</h5>
      <p>In my book, &ldquo;Stepping Beyond Intention&rdquo;, I touched on the idea of alignment that Jess (my co-creator on the &ldquo;Method Meets Magic&rdquo; project) and I also spoke about over the course of a 9-week series on creating the life you desire.</p>
      <p>The basic premise is that for any outcome to show up for you, there must be an alignment of our energy or emotions (energy in motion), our mindset &amp; beliefs, and the actions that we are at least positioned to take with a clear intention.</p>
      <p>For the purpose of this exercise, there are a few things that I want to highlight as we move into the mechanics of how this works: 
      <ol>
         <li>Two thirds of this is an inner game. We could say that &ldquo;manifesting&rdquo; is when the inner game is so deeply aligned and the intention so deeply seated, that action is not even required and the intention drops into our experience.</li>
         <li>Our beliefs about what can and cannot happen, and the way in which something can or cannot happen, must be aligned with our actions in order to allow it to happen.</li>
         <li>The mind does not lie to itself, so if we give the mind sufficient evidence to support our new proposition &ndash; in this case that we can create spontaneously &ndash; then resistance from the mind will fade away over time  (so long as we are subject to the illusion of time).</li>
      </ol>
      <p>In short, if we tighten up our inner game, then it can do the heavy lifting, creating enough momentum that it can eventually do all of the lifting &ndash; if we are aligned with that belief.</p>
      <hr id="lied" />
      <p><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></p>
      <h5 class="header">THEY LIED TO YOU</h5>
      <p>I used to get a little mad when the snake oil sellers spoke about putting a cheque on the wall and waiting for your millions to show up.</p>
      <div class="pull-quote">Manifestation doesn't happen without some form of Action</div>
      <p>A simple look to the ancients and their practices around honing the mind, spirit and even the body to achieve the supernatural feats that they did, will give a glimpse to the work that really goes into creating, outside of the normal paradigms.</p>
      <p>The popcorn culture of the west has, in many respects, bastardised the beauty of the work that must be done in order to break the old patterns of being.</p>
      <p>I speak about this a lot in all areas of my work. Some people would be better served sticking to their sob stories and working via the old paradigms of matter-to-matter creation, as they will not be ready to do the work of creating using 5<sup>th</sup> dimensional principals as we are doing here.</p>
      <p>In nearly 20 years, having searched deep in the caverns of open and secret knowledge, I am yet to find even a single case of a proven manifest who achieved anything without some form of action.</p>
      <hr id="suffering" />
      <p><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></p>
      <h5 class="header">THE FAIRY TALE ON SUFFERING</h5>
      <p>The inner work that must be done will not always be easy and the road will not always be smooth, but it is vital to do the work of shedding the stories that are the true source of suffering.</p>
      <p>It is the stories we have about things being hard that create the suffering around it, much like the stories around pain.</p>
      <p>I did an podcast interview some time ago with Jill Prescott on the truth around pain and invited the listeners to consider that pain itself is not the thing that is bad. Nature, as always, leads the way - a headache is a marker that we need to pay some attention to an area of our physical wellbeing in order to bring it back into equilibrium. In childbirth, pain signals new life.</p>
      <p>Work is not a cause for suffering. It can be a joy, if we choose to see the beauty in the power that it awakens within us to do the inner work, regardless of the outer appearances here and now.</p>
      <p><i>If you&rsquo;re doing everything right, it&rsquo;s not going wrong</i>.</p>
      <div class="pull-quote">The space between thinking and being is where we do our creation</div>
      <p>The idea that when you are doing everything right then nothing is going wrong, but is also coming just the way you asked for it, can be a little bit confusing. In life situations, many are the times when we do work, but the results do not seem to show up. This does not mean that we should despair. Sometimes it only means that we change our mindset, because the micro-shift in thinking can be that powerful. Once you think about it, you create it. The trick is that the space between thinking and being is where we do our creation.</p>
      <p>When we believe that something is going to happen, it happens. Whatever we decide to create consciously, or subconsciously, it is mandatory that we believe it first. The reason why sometimes it does not happen, is that our belief system has created a single road upon which it must happen.</p>
      <hr id="expectation" />
      <p><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></p>
      <h5 class="header">LINEAR EXPECTATION</h5>
      <p>The illusion of linear time sometimes makes us believe that there must be time space between when we set our intentions and them showing up. Some have a fantasy that they must work in a certain way in order to get what they want, but we must align our belief system with our thoughts. When, for instance one believes that they are going to make a big sum of the money, then their thoughts may well be aligned in such a way that they must work for it.</p>
      <p>It is essential that we shift our belief system definitively, to reflect what we want and according to <i>how</i> we want things to show up for us. Suppose one believes that in relationships it is hard to cope; you cannot find your Prince of joy, or it is you who have to differ each time then, indeed they are going to see it based on how they perceive it.</p>
      <p>Do not live as if something is going to happen, but instead live as though what you want has already been. It is consistently imprinting a new way of being on yourself until a time comes when you become what you want. When we want something, there has to be an alignment through our belief system.</p>
      <p>The other side of the coin, that speaks to what we have already looked at in terms of owning where you are with your intention; is working with where you are now to ensure that you create the alignment. If you know that work is your belief, then hold the frequency, work and get it. If time is a big one for you, then introduce practices in patience whilst the inevitable comes along the river of time.</p>
      <p>Don&rsquo;t like the belief systems that you have around bringing your intentions to life? Well why not just go ahead and change them&hellip;?</p>
      <div class="pull-quote">Honour your beliefs and work to create flow in the direction of the intended sum of money</div>
      <p>In relation to this process, that means to stick with it! I recall that one of my clients was stuck and unable to even call in her first dollar &ndash; by sitting with her on her beliefs and getting her into alignment with them, she ended up receiving 10,000 within a week or two for a tax return that she had not even filed yet!</p>
      <p>Allow yourself to honour your beliefs and work with them to create flow in the direction of your intended sum of money. Drop the amount to as low as a penny at first if you must, the sum just gives you a minimum deliverable. Your mind just needs this to be low enough to not have resistance, so that you can build up a nice pattern of success and dissolve the resistance at higher and higher levels.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Microshifting&rdquo; is taking a consistence series of baby steps in the direction of a chosen outcome. Push your edge without pushing your buttons. Just start nice and low to get the momentum going and before long you will call in thousands at a time, very much on purpose.</p>
      <p>Start nice and low. Go for no more than $5-10 (or the equivalent currency). Look for an amount of money that you believe you could find on the streets as your starting point and watch yourself flying in no time at all.</p>
      <hr id="framework" />
      <p><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></p>
      <h5 class="header">THE FRAMEWORK</h5>
      <p>I would like to offer you an insight into the mechanics of the universe, succinctly summarized neatly into what we call the &ldquo;Beyond Intention Flow Funnel.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>The Funnel Works on the basis of ancient wisdom, primarily distilled from lessons held in the Hermetic Teachings, that has since been backed up by scientific exploration of the various levels of density that make up our reality.</p>
      <p>In essence we are looking at the building blocks of reality, pure energy, slowing down and taking shape according to the &ldquo;instructions&rdquo; given to it. This is happening all the time with our subconscious mind running the show (according to Dr Bruce Lipton and other leading researchers) up to 95% of the time.</p>
      <p>As energy slows down in frequency and takes shape, we connect with it as a being on a range of densities. Each level of density, having different interactions, some of which support the energy dropping to another level of density, and some that represent resistance that stops any further development.</p>
      <p>When we have a thought, any thought, it slows down and becomes a thing that we experience with our five senses, here in the third dimension. The only time this does not happen is when the journey of that thought is disrupted by resistance. The money game is designed to cut resistance to the experience of money showing up for you in microshifts, that bypass the security systems in the mind, reprogramming them to allow for infinite possibility. 
      <div style="text-align: center; padding: 20px 0;"> <img src="images/Money%20Game%20ebook%20-%20edited_html_e1eb8634a5110bee.jpg" name="image14.jpg" align="bottom" width="295" height="364" border="0" /></div>
      <p>I taught a class on the specific application of this wisdom for Micro2Millions in relation to creating money, but again, these principles can be applied to the creation of anything and we will look at some of those later on in this book.</p>
      <p>As you can see in the above diagram, there are three general environments, or levels of density, that make up our reality once we drop into the polarity that occurs in the forth dimension of time.</p>
      <p>This is not restrictive of the infinity of reality, but a reflection of the hermetic teachings that of course go much further into this and break down further sub categories within these. You have the spiritual/energetic environment (I veer towards &ldquo;energy&rdquo; vs &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; as it has several connotations, but as everything is energy there can at times be confusion when not using spiritual, but the two are interchangeable). Next up is the mental environment and then the physical, which is where we engage with reality though our five primary senses.</p>
      <p>I am going to explain what each of these environments are and then going to show you how the Money Game offers an easy to follow strategy that you can employ to clear where the resistance lies for you.</p>
      <p>The most important thing to remember is that the money game has built into it the intentions that are tried and tested. They are based on over a decade and a half of research, testing and experimenting, to ensure that the intentions get the results that they are supposed to get.</p>
      <p>Now as we looked at before, every single thought that you have shows up in your reality. The only ones that do not show up viscerally in your reality as something that you physically experience, are those that are met with resistance in any of these three environments, or do not have a clear, viable intention. The viability of the intention I might add, is determined only by your belief systems about what is possible. The Money Game stretches and expands this belief around money.</p>
      <hr id="time" />
      <p><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></p>
      <h5 class="header">TIME IS NOT REAL</h5>
      <p>The fact of the matter is that in nature, the thing that we call &ldquo;time&rdquo; does not exist. It just doesn't exist. All that we have are clocks. We have the movements and cycles of nature, but none of these things directly correlate in any way to the seconds, minutes, hours, days, months and years that we collectively agree to call &ldquo;time&rdquo;. So the only thing standing time-wise between you and any of these or other intentions that you set for yourself is the illusion that we have all agreed to: that things must take time without that illusion.</p>
      <div class="pull-quote">Time is an illusion between you and the intended manifestation</div>
      <p>Things can and do show up instantly and this happens in some things in our life, as we will see as we go through the three environments we are going to look at today. So as I said, the very first thing that must be there is a clear intention, and every time that we move into another phase of the money game, we set the intention following a specific formula that does the job of pulling this down through the flow funnel.</p>
      <p>Now, this isn't necessarily a linear process; in fact the funnel is happening at lightening speed as energy expands and contracts, in and out of form. The offering of the flow funnel gives a framework within which tweaks to the system can be made, so that you have a new upgraded autopilot that works on command.</p>
      <p>You can then start to apply specific strategies such as The Money Game to overcome other resistance lines. By that I mean, anyone who tells you that anything has an absolute and that things ONLY work when they are done their &ldquo;specific way&rdquo;, I would suggest for you to run away from them. We live in a Universe of infinite possibilities, and the purpose of this game is to open you up to those possibilities.</p>
      <p>Once the intention has been dropped into the flow funnel, it then is a matter of it moving through the three environments and showing up in our lives. Now I think this is a very apt time to step into what the first environment is, the environment of spirit.</p>
      <p>In this energy environment we're looking at the level of density that relates to feelings, emotions, the metaphysical realm and what we might call the sprit world, with all things related to lower density states of being. In my work, I speak a lot to how this connects with spiritual practices such as prayer and meditation, and how to direct the power of these practices to specific results. In Beyond Intention, we deliberately use this power to create a super charged container, into which we place our intentions and leverage the power of this container to create the outcomes we desire.</p>
      <p>In Micro2Millions we have a variety of energy based modalities that we employ to blast through any resistance to unlimited wealth and abundance in the lives of our members. One tool that supplements that work is The Money Game and here is how.</p>
      <div class="pull-quote">We are Manifestation Electromagnets</div>
      <p>When moving through each phase, do not let the process of writing your intention be a passive thing. Feel the feelings associated with each intention, document if you must what those feelings are, and use memories of past experiences where you have felt those feelings and emotions to create a framework for how to feel now. Consciousness cannot be in two places at the same time, so when you bring your awareness to a time where you felt those feelings, then that is the frequency that your feelings are programming into your body now. As we are powerful electro magnets, those feelings and the associated frequency that we call in, connects us to the experiences that relate to them.</p>
      <p>Now this book is not an in depth exploration of the creation process as a whole, and I invite you to grab a copy of my book, Stepping Beyond Intention, for a deeper understanding of this. Here in this book, we are simply dipping in, to get the flavour of how the simple model of The Money Game works.</p>
      <p>This environment is also concerned with where we focus our energy and attention. So if our energy is scattered because we're doing multiple things, or our attention is in multiple places, then our energy is going to be scattered too. In fact, one of the things that often causes disruption or resistance in our energy environment is simply just having our energy spread out and not focused in one place.</p>
      <p>In Beyond Intention we talk about energy traps in relation to step two. In fact, step two of the Beyond Intention paradigm is all about removing energy traps and collecting your energy in one space, the &ldquo;Now&rdquo; or the present moment, because as we said a short while ago, time doesn't really exist &ndash; the Now is all there really is.</p>
      <p>When setting your intentions, be present in the process. Set those moments aside as sacred and commit yourself to conscious creation. Being present in the now is something that I cannot underestimate the importance of. The choice to direct the creative power can only be exercised in the Now.</p>
      <p>It came up once on a group call for Micro2Millions that one of our members did not feel good about being rich. In fact, some of the drop off that we have seen has been because people used the excuse of not wanting to be rich as a reason to stay broke, and in a place of lack. All this despite the purpose of the Mastermind being to open up our members to be able to freely make the choice about whether or not they want to be rich.</p>
      <p>This feeling for them, that being rich did not make them feel good on the inside, can be a powerful block to creating wealth and is one that for some pockets of society is pushed with some gusto. &ldquo;Money is the root of all evil&rdquo;, the misrepresentation of the full statement that &ldquo;the LOVE of money is the root of all evil&rdquo;, has been used as a tool (unintentionally just as much as intentionally) forever.</p>
      <p>Leaving such a disruption in your emotional connection to money will always leave a potent level of resistance, that stops the flow of any money related intentions being made manifest. Fear, doubt, anxiety and other feelings of this nature MUST be cleared to create an open path for your money related intentions to flow.</p>
      <p>We must be mindful in general of all things, both agreeable and disagreeable, that pull our energy out of the present moment. Anything that scatters your focus and distracts from where your energy should be, will prevent you from holding the intention of creating new outcomes in your life. Equally, allowing our focus to be pulled by experiences or aspects of our lives that do not bring us joy, will unwittingly cause us to create more of them.</p>
      <p>Sometimes the codes of conduct that we live by, even those designed by us to create wealth and abundance, can cause energy traps and focus blocks because of how they limit our creativity. We can tend to focus on abiding by these codes to the letter or extreme, placing our energy on following the rules rather than on creating.</p>
      <p id="books">Work in the emotional field can be some of the toughest to undertake. Hard-wired energy traps in this environment can, sometimes, take a lot of truly deep work to break free from. Some examples of tools that can be used to effectively do so are listed in the Appendix, and there is also support available through one of our group programs such as Micro2Millions that also has a kick start guide available via <a href="#dan" @click="myLink('http://www.dreamwithdan.com/')">www.dreamwithdan.com/books</a>.</p>
      <p>So by working on clearing those, again, the resistance clears and without the resistance there is a flood and as long as there's flow, we can move from the energy environment into the mental environment. So focus your attention, get in touch with the feelings, feel good about those feelings and break free of the energy traps.</p>
      <div class="pull-quote">Connection with the creators speeds up your alignment</div>
      <p>The mental environment is populated by our thoughts, our beliefs and our mindset. It also is fed by the inputs that we give to our mind and here's a really, really cool thing: changing your mindset does not mean fighting the mindset that's there. It doesn't mean fighting the beliefs that you have already. Actually, the very simple matter is, it just means producing evidence that is aligned with the intention you wanted to see become real.</p>
      <p>And so let's say for example, your limiting belief is that it's not possible for anybody to make &pound;1,600. Well, with a clear intention and clear path in your energetic environment, all you actually need to do is spend time connecting with people who have created the &pound;1,600. For some of you that may mean connecting with people that are closer to you in life experience, so that you don't have that resistance.</p>
      <hr id="mind" />
      <p><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></p>
      <h5 class="header">THE MIND JUST FOLLOWS PROTOCOLS</h5>
      <p>The mind is not set up to lie to itself, it is simply following protocols that have been fed to it by prior inputs. By giving it evidence via your inputs and from that space in your mind&rsquo;s eye, seeing the intention as a done thing, you create an open path to manifesting your intention.</p>
      <p>Gathering that evidence might be looking back at your life and seeing the times that you have actually had real experiences of being at that level of abundance. It may be that you just go and start connecting online with stories of people that have achieved things, looking at inspiring and motivating stories, connecting with them and whatever medium relates to you personally.</p>
      <div class="pull-quote">Frustration of non-creation occurs when we carbon-copy others</div>
      <p>Sufficient evidence and the mind can no longer hold the story. With those stories no longer there, the ability to mentally rehearse the experience and visualise it follows through on the feeling work and allows the intention to increase in density, stepping closer to being something experienced with the five senses.</p>
      <p>No two people are going to have the same challenges and therefore it's not really optimal to try and produce a cookie cutter approach to everybody breaking through what their resistance is. It has to be a matter of personal exploration. The attempt to carbon copy another&rsquo;s road to success, sometimes is the thing that creates the frustration of non-creation that we feel in our lives.</p>
      <p>Modelling our method on others' will always be most optimally served by making the tweaks to the system that make it YOURS. That said, where the one your are modelling is closer to your combination of archetypes (more on those later) it may be possible to more closely follow their exact steps.</p>
      <p>One very powerful hack that I will offer you, that we generally spend a lot of our time on with private coaching, is developing a mindset that is open to infinite possibilities. You see it is physically impossible for us to experience anything that we don't believe is possible. The belief systems that we have literally hold hostage any intention that we have set, if we do not align it with being true. This is why I get you in to a slightly altered state when we do the intention setting. It is also why I employ the strategies and science of Lynne McTaggart in her book &ldquo;<i>The Power of Eight</i>&rdquo;, collecting dozens of you to use the power of your collective, collaborative energy to supercharge the intention and dissolve resistance.</p>
      <p>Your belief systems are what will ultimately dictate what is possible. Overcoming their limitations is not a matter of fighting it, but taking complete ownership, complete integration of all the belief systems that you have right now, and then simply making the choice to introduce inputs into your mental environment that support the truth of what you want to see. By spending time being abundant in the present, using the tactics and strategies I give you, such as playing the Money Game, you will start to break down resistance and prove to yourself that everything you want is already yours.</p>

      <h5 class="header">THE SYSTEM</h5>
      <p>Now as I said, this system has so far been exclusively taught to my top paying clients and mastermind members.</p>
      <p>The money Game has three core phases: 
      <ul>
         <li>Phase 1. Establishing your edge</li>
         <li>Phase 2. Pushing your edge</li>
         <li>Phase 3. Cementing your edge</li>
      </ul>
      <p> Each of these phases involves playing the game 5 times (&ldquo;rounds&rdquo;), on each occasion stretching your edge whilst staying within a strict framework.</p>
      <p>Phase one: We stay within whatever shows up as our edge, or if our edge is revealed initially as the sum we asked for and no more, then we push that amount incrementally until we start calling in sums over and above this.</p>
      <p>I suggest staying tight to the amount you asked for on the previous round. There are a number of reasons for this, principally that you don&rsquo;t want to spook the subconscious mind by asking it to allow anything too far outside of what it has deemed acceptable/possible. Pushing the round by anything from $&pound;&euro;1-5 is plenty, just make sure that there is some expansion.</p>
      <p>Phase two: Here we go to the outer edge for the first time on the initial round, we then stretch this in increments of roughly 20% on each round.</p>
      <p>Phase three: We start this phase by going to 50% of whatever our outer edge was revealed as, and then move up in increments leading up to the edge. An example would be that if you edge was revealed as 1000, you would (on the first round of this phase) intend and create 500 or more. Each round you would then get closer and closer to 1000, perhaps in increments of 100 for each round.</p>
      <div class="pull-quote">The game's primary purpose is to expose your mind to the experience of first-hand evidence of money coming to you.</div>
      <p>It is perfectly normal at first to receive less than what we asked for, &ldquo;things in kind&rdquo; such coupons or gifts etc... When this happens, be grateful for it and celebrate the gift of abundance, but then connect with what it would feel like to have the sum you asked for. Celebrate smaller sums or in kind gifts as though they were the sum you asked for, or more, and then visualise what it would feel like for this to have been cash in hand/in the bank instead.</p>
      <p><i>This game is about having cash in hand or at the bank</i></p>
      <p>This game&rsquo;s principal purpose is to expose your mind to the experience of first hand evidence of money coming to you, with you not having to reach out for it. You may have to take action to formalise receiving the gift, but ideally you are not to reach out and look for it, it should just show up.</p>
      <p>The member&rsquo;s of my <i>Microshift 2 Millions Mastermind</i> Group have experienced all sorts of ways for this to happen. Some have found bank accounts that they didn&rsquo;t know about or thought were closed. One person found thousands in crypto currency that they did not know about. Some have received unknown bonuses. Others had utility companies send them cash back or even get tax rebates. There are many ways that it can happen, the trick is to be open by not trying to dictate the how. It is called a &ldquo;game&rdquo; and starts with insignificant sums for a reason.</p>
      <p>This is how you play each round. I will go through the stages next, but for now I want to show you how to actually play each round.</p>
      <p>Write on a piece of paper:</p>
      <p>&ldquo;<i>Today I intend and create $&pound;&euro;20 or more to come to me in an easy and playful way!</i></p>
      <p><i>I am open and ready to receive this gift of abundance in my life now.</i>&rdquo;</p>
      <p>On the same piece of paper, write 5 things you&rsquo;re grateful for here and now. These do not have to be tied to anything, the important thing is that you are truly grateful for them.  As you write each one, close your eyes for a moment and really connect to the memory of the experience you are grateful for. Bring in as many of the senses as you can. This makes it more real for you. Closing your eyes enables you to focus on the experience more intensely.</p>
      <p>Here is a very important next step that often people get confused about. Once you have done this, fold this piece of paper and never look at it again.</p>
      <p>One thing that we have found is that people want to know how long it will or should take. There is no hard and fast rule at all, but the wording of the intention says that it happens &ldquo;now&rdquo;. That wording invites you to have it immediately, so it is only your beliefs around the amount that delay it.</p>
      <p>During Phase One is when it is most vital to settle into this way of doing things. I invite you to drop to as low as &pound;&euro;$1 for the very first round if you are stuck after more than a week or two. Following that, do your best not to think about the time anymore. It WILL show up, it just might take time. I have played the game and got the money the same day, and other times it has taken a month (in the earlier days before I really narrowed things down).</p>
      <p>Now to look at how we slot this into the phases I described earlier on&hellip;</p>
      <h6 class="header">Phase One</h6>
      <p>Round One: start with no more than $&pound;&euro;20. The lower the starting sum, the better in all honesty, especially if this whole concept is really new to you.</p>
      <p>You will have one of a few things happen:</p>
      <p>1 You get less than what you asked for &ndash; get grateful, celebrate as if you had gotten the whole amount or more. I suggest giving this sum away with an open heart.</p>
      <p>2 You receive a like sum in kind: gift tokens, coupons etc...(one of our Mastermind members received hundreds of dollars in free train tickets) &ndash; Celebrate, have gratitude for this and visualise what it would feel like for it to have been cash in hand (or at the bank). I suggest sharing this gift with someone who is in need.</p>
      <p>3 You receive the exact amount you asked for &ndash; in this case this is your &ldquo;edge&rdquo; and you will start to expand this by increasing by no more than $&pound;&euro;1-5 for the following round.</p>
      <p>4 You get more than you asked for &ndash; You will stay within this edge for the rest of this phase. Note: at any point in this round you might have this happen or indeed at any point in the game. The &ldquo;Edge&rdquo; is the amount that you sub conscious mind is able to accept as possible when you say &ldquo;or more&rdquo; in the money game statement. It is the expression of where you have resistance around money coming to you without you doing something to &ldquo;pull&rdquo; or &ldquo;call&rdquo; it in.</p>
      <p>Play the game for five rounds, incrementally raising the amount each time by just a little bit. Each time remember to write &ldquo;or more&rdquo; in your statement and stay within the edge (where this has shown itself as being more than you have asked for), or pushing by just a little bit where you have continued to receive what you asked for.</p>
      <p>After 5 times, we move on to phase two</p>
      <h6 class="header">Phase Two</h6>
      <p>Here we are starting at, what you should agree, is Round Six of the overall game. We start by asking for the amount that showed up as the edge. We remember to ask for &ldquo;or more&rdquo; and no matter what sum shows up (that amount or higher) we push this Round Six sum by 20%.</p>
      <p>So, for instance, if your outer edge was the same 1000 from our example earlier, no matter if you get 1000 or 20000, Round Seven (the second of the five rounds in this phase) you would make the statement a request for 1,200 or more to come to you in an easy and playful way.</p>
      <p>If you get less, then as before you get into a state of gratitude, celebrate it and give some, or all of the money away.</p>
      <p>Once you have done this for five rounds, we move on to Phase Three where we anchor in your ability to call in these increasingly expanded sums.</p>
      <h6 class="header">Phase Three</h6>
      <p>Now we take the most recent edge (the largest sum that has shown up for us playing this game) and we start this phase (Round 11 of the overall game) at 50% of that amount. We then edge back up to this edge (a bigger edge will most likely show up during this round) staying within it at all times.</p>
      <p>As explained earlier, if this edge was say 1000, you would play the following rounds as a suggested order:</p>
      <p>11 &ndash; 500</p>
      <p>12 &ndash; 600</p>
      <p>13 &ndash; 700</p>
      <p>14 &ndash; 800</p>
      <p>15 &ndash; 900</p>
      <p>Remember that we are always asking &ldquo;or more&rdquo;, so the amount you ask for in reality is not all that important. The steps herein have been laid out in a particular way. Stick to them and remember to have FUN. Once you have made it through all 15 rounds, you can start applying this to amounts of money you actually need for different purposes.</p>
      <hr id="tips" />
      <p><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></p>
      <h5 class="header">PRO-TIPS</h5>
      <p>So you have made it through all 15 rounds and established that the &ldquo;<i>Money Game&rdquo;</i> really works. Let's now delve deeper and unlock even more potential by understanding more of what is going on.</p>
      <p>We have established our &ldquo;edge&rdquo; in Round One. This is the amount that our subconscious will allow for us to receive, without intervention in the &ldquo;how&rdquo;. This edge is our &ldquo;soft&rdquo; or &ldquo;hot&rdquo; edge, used for the (relatively) short-term purposes of the game. Our &ldquo;hard edge&rdquo;, conversely, is the largest amount of liquid cash that you have ever had in your possession, and at your disposal, at any time in your life. It will be deeply stored in your subconscious as the upper limit of what your mind is going to believe is possible.</p>
      <p>This hard edge is still subjecting us to a limiting belief system. For lots of people it will be an amount that they saved up for a big life-event like: buying a house, saving up the kids' college fund or taking out a large loan. Whatever it is, they have seen a large amount of money come into their possession, even if only for a few hours, and thus the mind believes that it is possible, because it actually happened. It is your &ldquo;hard&rdquo; edge because it is an amount that you do not normally experience, or maybe have only experienced once, and thus it represents the outer limits of possibility that will require more work to break through.</p>
      <p>Even in undertaking the small steps contained in the<i> &ldquo;Money Game&rdquo;</i>, you are chipping away at your resistance and progressively expanding your soft edge (where you're at most of the time). If you can do this, eventually you will surpass your hard edge with a strong support system that will keep you going.</p>
      <div class="pull-quote">Build a belief system that allows you to connect fully with the</div>
      <p>Statistically, roughly 80% of people stay in the same financial situation their whole life. 90% of lottery winners, within five years, end up right back in the same situation they were in before they won. It doesn't matter if they were poor, rich or somewhere in the middle, eventually they end up right back where they were, within their soft edge. This is because they have not built enough of a belief system, that allows them to connect fully with the money. They revert to wage-slavery because, hitherto, that has been their reality.</p>
      <p>The majority of the world, the developed world anyway, are slaves to their wages. If they lost their job, even the high-flyers would start to lose their lifestyle in a matter of a few months. They may have the illusion of financial abundance and freedom, with a big house, luxury car etc... but the reality is that they are not free.</p>
      <p>If you have to work you are not financially free. If you choose to work because you are no longer a slave to your wage packet, that is true financial freedom.</p>
      <p>The &ldquo;soft&rdquo; edge that we established in the &ldquo;<i>Money Game</i>&rdquo; is your spontaneous creation edge. What your mind believes it is possible for you to have without lifting a finger. For most people, this is going to start out very, very low. A lot of us will base it on what we are used to receiving as gifts at birthdays, Christmas etc... as this is our predominant experience of spontaneous receiving.</p>
      <p>Now this &ldquo;receiving edge&rdquo; does not necessarily mean physical experience. It can be in love, which is where the idea of &ldquo;love languages&rdquo; comes in. Love languages are the ways in which we process and understand love, not just romantic love but it is how we speak and hear the energy of love. This also includes love that translates into the level of abundance that we have.</p>
      <div class="pull-quote">Smaller sums are vital in creating the foundations of belief that allow the larger sums to come.</div>
      <p>For example, somebody for whom love language is an act of service, will not necessarily receive large sums of money, but rather an abundance of being cared for and given access to service. During the time that they are building their belief systems, if they have been cared for and had access to high levels of service, they will be energetically open to receiving them with fewer limits or blocks. They can also be so used to receiving non-monetary things (items, services etc...) that the limitation of money, simply does not exist in their world. This is likely to culminate in a less ridged soft edge when playing the &ldquo;<i>Money Game</i>&rdquo;. Indeed we have seen examples of this in our &ldquo;<i>Micros2Millions</i>&rdquo; group.</p>
      <p>I have had members of &ldquo;<i>Micros2Millions</i>&rdquo; drop out of the group and the &ldquo;<i>Money Game</i>&rdquo; because they insisted that they needed large sums of money now and could not waste time creating $200-300. They were losing sight of the fact that the smaller sums are vital in creating the foundations of belief, that allow the larger sums to come. Moreover, with an attitude of &ldquo;I need it now&rdquo; they were also creating energy and mindset blocks, stopping them from being able to create anything at all.</p>
      <p>It doesn't matter where you are at when you start, the point is to spend the time breaking down beliefs incrementally in order to build strong foundations to create more. It is a journey of micro-shifts after all. To a large degree; the wins of $10-$20 are worth more than someone going out and earning $1million, because those are the sums that create our foundations of belief. They take the most effort to mentally &ldquo;get the ball rolling&rdquo; and create the momentum to get to the larger sums. Just like the analogy of the man who built his house on sand verses rock, your &ldquo;Money Game House&rdquo; will stand or fall based on its foundations. As you start to step up to the bigger figures, the confidence and mastery of your mindset that you have built up will clear bigger and bigger blocks with ease.</p>
      <p>The first phase of five steps is deliberately about establishing your edge, and staying with in it. Not creating resistance but staying well within what our mind is comfortable with, in order that we build up momentum and strong foundations. It doesn't matter if we get more than we ask for, we still only increase our amount in small increments. The &ldquo;<i>or more</i>&rdquo; mantra is vital in this, as it cements what your limit is for you by the end of the first phase.</p>
      <p>Come phase two, we want to start pushing that limit/edge, which will likely be met with some resistance at first. Very soon though, with the support of strong foundations, your mind will start to see and feel the wins. It is at this stage that we also start to force ourselves to give away chunks of our wins.</p>
      <p>Even if you receive less than you ask for, and even though it will hurt in the short term to give away a large portion of it, this is about creating an abundance vacuum. The more you can go beyond where it hurts, while holding the faith and frequency that more is coming, the more you create space for that abundance to come in.</p>
      <p>This tithing can be tough, especially when the bigger numbers start to roll in. You will no doubt start to think of all of the debts you can clear, or big changes you can make in yours and your family's life, but this is reverting to an energy and mindset of &ldquo;lack.&rdquo; This will put up a block that assumes that you will never see more. You can, of course, practice this without large sums of money. Simply being giving of your time or energy from a place of love, and celebrating it as if it were thousands, creates the frequency. It sets the mind up for giving from a place of abundance.</p>
      <p>Hold the frequency and experience of celebrating the wins as if they were a million, and the blocks will clear. So much so that eventually you will be able to call in more than just sums of money. You'll be creating clients for your business or experiences and opportunities way outside of what you thought was possible at the beginning. The obstacle to all this abundance was you, but now you are a different person, one with a supercharged ability to play with and redirect energy.</p>

      <h5 class="header">MANIFESTING FROM MICRO&hellip;  TO MILLIONS</h5>
      <p><i>How to make a million bucks show up out of &ldquo;nowhere&rdquo;</i></p>
      <p>The first thing that I would offer is to not even go for it.</p>
      <p>Yes, the reality is that the energetic composition of $1 is the same as $1,000,000 and everywhere in between, but as we have seen with the <i>Flow Funnel,</i> our beliefs are the gate keeper of our experience.</p>
      <p>If you have never been witness to you creating such a sum, then you just will not have the capacity to do so now. Moreover, attempting the task with the gap that likely exists between where you are in your current experience and the lofty goal of a million, will likely only breed failure in your attempt, which, when compounded, will seek to scupper any future endeavours.</p>
      <p>The solution does, however, rest in your hands &ndash; microshift through the journey to a million instead.</p>
      <p>A simple framework that facilitates a microshifted journey up to one million or more was put forward by a mentor of mine two decades ago. He suggested that if you take a penny and double that same penny 28 times, you end up with 1.28 million (with some rounding up and down along the way). I have successfully undertaken his challenge (which had some pretty strict rules) and this formula is also the basis for the Micro2Millions project.</p>
      <p>We are following a variation of the original formula by another of my mentors, who suggests starting at 100 and undertaking the project in 14 steps. We are going to use a mix of the two and some of what we have looked at earlier in this book, to create a viable model for manifesting your own million in an achievable way.</p>
      <p>Firstly, it is important that you do not seek to undertake this endeavour until you have successfully done all 15 steps of the above &ldquo;Money Game&rdquo; instructions. The reason is that the opening up to infinite possibility that this will create, will serve you when we &ldquo;pull it back a little&rdquo; and move forward with a much less strict set of rules.</p>
      <p>The very first thing we will do is break each double into it&rsquo;s own money game. So step one &ndash; taking 100 and turning it into 200 &ndash; will be a money game within itself. Setting the intention of creating the 100 of capital growth in bite-sized chunks which get us to the promised land of 200, as a total capital base.</p>
      <p>This might look like &ldquo;20 or more&rdquo;, followed by &ldquo;30 or more&rdquo; followed by &ldquo;50 or more&rdquo;, each time opening yourself up to infinite possibilities as to how the money might be created. By doing this in further steps, you are completely removing all opportunity for resistance, as you are effectively undertaking a microshift within a microshift.</p>
      <p>The difference here is also that you are allowed to &ldquo;do&rdquo; versus the money game rules of not lifting a finger. Because you have opened up the mind to the possibility of money showing up, without you NEEDING to do anything, being open and ready to &ldquo;do&rdquo; creates a powerful space within which it CAN come to you, without you doing anything, but you are open to taking inspired action.</p>
      <p>Another difference I would offer is that, initially, instead of shooting for the money itself, you can create the means with which to generate the money. This might be a client, sale or resource that brings in the wealth you seek. This is how we more generally create in Micro2Millions, but the really cool thing is that because we have done the work of opening up, infinite possibilities are available to us.</p>
      <p>Using this formula, no matter where you are you can create flow and alignment to unlimited wealth. As you will see in the next section there is plenty of scope to apply the Money Game to all areas not only of business and wealth generation, but life.</p>
      <hr id="applications" />
      <p><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></p>
      <h5 class="header">OTHER APPLICATIONS OF THE GAME</h5>
      <p>There are several applications of this game. I would like to invite you to join me on my next free abundance webinar, where you can ask me directly any questions that you have, regarding the examples that I have given of my clients having success with this model.</p>
      <p>Here, however, I will give you one or two ideas on how to apply these principles, that you can play with once you get into the swing of creating with this model on a consistent basis.</p>
      <p><i>- Getting clients</i></p>
      <p>We use a specifically drafted version of this formula in our purpose driven peak performance work. We create six/seven figure plus value creators, made up of teams and entrepreneurs, based on these same principals of abundance, as well as our extensive research and testing on mindful business principals.</p>
      <p id="dan2">For more on that please head over to <a href="#dan2" @class="myLink('http://www.dreamwithdan.com/')">www.dreamwithdan.com</a> where you can also find out about our corporate training. Here we teach about flow states, the power of collaborative energy, intuitive decision making, time mastery and the significance of relationship capital.</p>
      <p>Microshift through the stages of client acquisition starting with the very lowest entry. If you have struggled to get a discovery call, start with a new follower to your blog or social media account and do that consistently before creating a mark of interest from a stranger. Work your way up to a call, then a call back, a request for a quote etc... Do NOT go directly for a paying customer &ndash; take the time to do this properly regardless of how long it takes to build the new pattern.</p>
      <p>At the start of this should be a clear intention as to the type of customer/client you want to attract to your business, as your mental blueprint will be exactly reflected in who shows up.</p>
      <p><i>- In You Career</i></p>
      <p>Don't start by looking for the pay rise, or promotion, just start by being considered for it. Here's where I tend to part ways with a lot of other teachers: I encourage you to work with what you believe is possible now, while you expand it. If, for you, getting the pay rise or promotion is centered around doing a better job, then do a better job. This is the &ldquo;acting&rdquo; part of the flow funnel. If your belief is that you need to work harder, then that is what is needed to begin making the shifts towards your goal.</p>
      <p><i>- Finding love</i></p>
      <p>Again, start small! Start with a smile from someone you find interesting, work up to a chance meeting with no pressure or expectations. From there dates and more. It must be centred on your intention for what you want to experience in relationship, not as a check list that you mark off, but as a pattern of the feelings you want to experience in the relationship that you desire.</p>
      <p>I recommend getting your hands on my book on intention setting, Stepping Beyond Intention, for some hacks on how to really get super clear with your intentions.</p>
      <p><i>- Free tickets</i></p>
      <p>I think you guess what I am going to say here? Start small! Go for coupons, something you have had given to you in the past and build up a pattern of success of just getting something as you start to cement a clear path to concert tickets, free flights and upgrades.</p>

      <h5 class="header">DOES IT REALLY WORK?</h5>
      <p>Below are some results that have been reported by player of this game &ndash; evidence of their reports are all available on request and many of them would even be happy to talk about how this game has completely flipped their relationship to money and manifesting it effortlessly.</p>
      <p>Plenty of people have much smaller wins on the way here and many of the people who have played this game will tell you that there have been times when they didn&rsquo;t think it would happen!</p>
      <p>I will tell you what I tell anyone who I have taught his game to &ndash; stick with it, start small and HAVE FUN!</p>

      <h5 class="header">CLEARING TOOLS</h5>
      <p>Below is a directory of some of the tools pulled from the Beyond Intention Clearing Encyclopaedia that we have effectively used in our work with Micro2Millions, to really clear out any blocks to financial abundance and get that level of density aligned with our intentions.</p>
      <p id="dan3"><a name="_gjdgxs"></a> This is really a tiny sample of the catalogue of modalities that have been tried and tested over the past nearly 20 years. The full encyclopaedia is available in the free resources section of <a href="#dan3" @class="myLink('http://www.dreamwithdan.com/')">www.dreamwithdan.com</a> and is also included in my best selling book, <i>Stepping Beyond Intention.</i></p>
      <h6><i>Heartspeak </i></h6>
      <p id="courses">&ndash; in particular the <a href="#courses" @click="myLink('http://heartspeak.com/courses/')">Heartspeak &ldquo;Money Protocol&rdquo;</a> by Dr. Anne Jensen.</p>
      <p>As the human race grows in awareness, the interventions of yesterday become inadequate. At the cutting edge of mindbody medicine, HeartSpeak is the next-generation healing tool you have been waiting for.</p>
      <p>Feelings are the primary drivers of thoughts, actions, behaviours, and bodily functions. With HeartSpeak, you are more capable of responding &ndash; rather than reacting. With HeartSpeak, you can regain conscious choice once more.</p>
      <p>HeartSpeak principles are based in cutting-edge research from the fields of neuroscience, the science of feeling (i.e. affective science), and the science of learning and memory. During a HeartSpeak session, you will be gently and purposefully guided through challenging emotions that trigger unwanted reactions. Once you are through the challenging emotion, you will pivot to a more preferable, pleasant feeling. After the HeartSpeak clearing, you experience an immediate sense of relief, and next you will notice that triggers are softened and there is more ease in your life. You will love it!</p>
      <p>HeartSpeak can be used on any feeling that may be distributing your ease. For example, HeartSpeak can be used to reduce certain physical symptoms, such as chronic pain, muscle tension and fatigue. HeartSpeak can also be used to lessen the emotionality of feeling symptoms, such as painful memories, and feelings of anxiousness, glumness, and stressed. There are so many applications for HeartSpeak &ndash; if you can feel it, you can clear it!</p>
      <p>To benefit from HeartSpeak, you can visit a HeartSpeak practitioner, or you can take a course and learn the HeartSpeak Principles, so that you will have the tools to help yourself. Courses are offered in various formats: in-person, online live and online video &ndash; choose the format that works best for you.</p>
      <p>Thousands have been helped through HeartSpeak all over the world. Are you ready for it?</p>
      <p>&ldquo;<i>HeartSpeak blew me away! It is the most powerful and immediate tool I have come across. AND it is within everybody&rsquo;s reach.&rdquo;</i>  <br />
         Valerie (Canada)
      </p>
      <p>&ldquo;<i>I am very surprised at the effectiveness of HeartSpeak! I love how easy it is to shift things quickly. Looking forward to using it in my life!&rdquo;<br />
         </i>Juan (USA)
      </p>
      <p>&ldquo;<i>I came away with tools I could easily incorporate into my current practice. Being able to pinpoint the issue without the client getting caught up in it all was invaluable to the ease of creating change.&rdquo;<br />
         </i>Rob (United Kingdom)
      </p>
      <p>&ldquo;<i>What I love about HeartSpeak is its powerful simplicity and its wide range of benefits. I have experienced everything from headache relief, amazing improvements with asthma and allergies, removing writer's block, releasing fears around money and so much more!</i>&rdquo; <br />

      <h6><i>EFT (Emotional Freedom Techniques)</i></h6>
      <p>EFT or&nbsp;Tapping&nbsp;is a form of Energy Psychology where one actually taps on meridian&nbsp;endpoints on the face and body while focusing on whatever issue they are working on. EFT is wonderful for releasing trapped painful memories from the body whether physical or emotional, as well as for releasing phobias, stress, sadness or anger to name a few. These are just a few examples of the countless ways that EFT can help clear blocks or limiting beliefs that may be holding one back from creating the life of one's dreams.</p>
      <p><i>Binaural Frequencies &amp; Healing Music</i></p>
      <p>Stream tapestries of music composed in 432Hz and 444Hz stitched with binaural &amp; isochronic solfeggio tones, nature sounds, bells, chimes, and crystal bowls. By listening to audio reproductions of harmonious brainwave states and carefully crafted compositions in alternate tunings our music is able to harmonize your mood, mind, body, office &amp; living spaces.</p>
      <p>Your mind exists in five different brainwave states throughout the day depending upon your activity. These brainwave states also correspond to your emotions and mood. If you&rsquo;re tired midday and wish to perk up we need to bring your brainwave state from theta to alpha, beta, or gamma. If you&rsquo;re wired and frazzled and would like to focus then we need to balance the hemispheres of your brain and bring your mind into a balanced theta, alpha, or beta state. By listening to audio reproductions of a desired brainwave state you can put yourself into your desired corresponding mood state within minutes. Live with your heart forward and your mind open. Peace &amp; Love.</p>

      <h6><i>Theta Healing</i></h6>
      <p>One of the most powerful energy-healing techniques, ThetaHealing&reg; is a process of meditation that we believe creates physical, psychological, and spiritual healing using the Theta brain wave. While in a pure Theta state of mind, we are able to connect to the Creator of All That Is through focused prayer.</p>
      <p>It is through the Creator of All That Is that we learned how to create physical healing, progress spiritually, and find a path to enlightenment. ThetaHealing&reg; was born and proved its validation to Vianna through what she believes to be the spontaneous healing of my leg.</p>
      <p>We all have different motivation for learning something like ThetaHealing&reg;. Some people are searching for knowledge, some are merely curious, and others have less altruistic motives. But the majority of people who learn it are pure of heart and seeking to expand ability that are lying dormant in their mind. This is what ThetaHealing&reg; is designed to do, teach people how to harness their psychic abilities through spiritual awareness.</p>

      <h5 class="header">THE JOURNAL TEMPLATE</h5>
      <p><a name="_GoBack"></a> This simple journal template will help give you some structure in how best you can document your journey. Journaling is a powerful tool and I really recommend that on top of using the table I gave you earlier, that you also journal on the completion of each step using this template: 
      <ul>
         <li>Step Number</li>
         <li>amount intention was for</li>
         <li>Amount that showed up</li>
         <li>How you felt as it showed upv
         <li>How you celebrated &ndash; how did it feel?</li>
         <li>Who you shared the news of the success with and why</li>
         <li>How much you are setting an intention for now</li>
         <li>How you feel going into the next step</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Notice that this does not mention the date &ndash; I don&rsquo;t want you to get caught up in how long each step takes! The less you give energy to the idea of time, the less of a hold it has on you!</p>

    <h5>Introduction</h5>

    <p>“Can you share your Law of Attraction manifestation story?”</p>

    <p>That’s a question most students of LOA like to get answered whenever possible. </p>

    <p>The basic concept of LOA is simple. As Abraham-Hicks puts it, “That which is like 
      unto itself is drawn.”</p>

    <p>But what about applying LOA in their “real world” lives? That’s where students of 
      LOA often trip up. So hearing the successful manifestation stories of others often 
      help us all to believe, despite what “reality” insists on telling us.</p>

    <p>I put that word “reality” into quotation marks to remind us that reality is what 
      we make of it and that even scientists have trouble making sense out of it.</p>

    <p>Once Albert Einstein ripped open Pandora’s Box with his General and Special Theories 
      of Relativity in the early twentieth century, human scientists stopped thinking of 
      reality as being fixed and immutable. Now there’s quantum physics, dark energy, the 
      observer effect, and a host of other relatively new scientific terms invented to make 
      sense out of what Einstein uncovered, stuff which often seems almost insensible.</p>

    <p>The New Thought movement of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the 
      precursor of modern day LOA thought, latched onto Einstein quickly, but the scientific 
      community didn’t accept New Thought explanations as anything but “nonsense” or “wishful 
      thinking”. To this day, the Law of Attraction and its other related concepts are largely 
      ridiculed and rejected by mainstream science.</p>

    <p>That “reality” does not stop the rest of us from exploring and embracing the Law of 
      Attraction. To the contrary, so many people have taken an interest in LOA that it has 
      become a worldwide phenomenon.  Rhonda Byrne’s movie, The Secret, helped LOA reach many 
      millions of people who had not previously heard of it, and it has gained significant 
      recognition among the population.</p>

    <p>I discovered LOA by watching The Secret for the first time in November 2008. My first 
      reaction was skepticism, but I was also in such a bad place in my own life that I was 
      willing to consider almost anything. And so I did. I launched into a personal study of 
      this LOA thing, determined to either harness it for myself or to prove it to be a bunch 
      of rot.</p>

    <p>In September 2012, with the help of my wife, Louise, I decided to start a podcast on 
      the subject. I called it LOA Today, and it became my personal way to explore LOA concepts 
      by interviewing other people who knew more about it than I did.</p>

    <p>To my surprise and pleasure, I found that the podcast became one of my favorite things 
      to do, even though I had no listeners at all at first and only an occasional listener 
      dropping in throughout most of the first year.</p>
    
    <p>In the second year after a brief sabbatical, my brother, Mark and his then-girlfriend 
      (now wife), Uohna became my co-hosts.</p>

    <p>By the third year, Mark and Uohna had given way to Joel Elston, one of my first 
      interviewees in Episode 12. Joel stayed with me until April 2017, at which point he had 
      to leave the show to attend to other things in his life.</p>

    <p>David Scott Bartky took Joel’s place, and during that summer something remarkable began 
      to happen. Our listenership started to increase at a rapid rate. By November 2017, we had 
      as many episodes played in a month as had been played in all the previous five years 
      combined.</p>

    <p>That led to me expanding the podcast to a twice daily broadcast, and I brought on board 
      Wendy Dillard, Cindie Chavez, and Tom Wells to co-host the shows with me, with Joel Elston 
      returning to the show as well (to my delight).</p>

    <p>The one characteristic all of my co-hosts shared in common is that they are professional 
      life coaches or therapists. I figured that if I was going to do a podcast, I wanted expert 
      commentary.</p>

    <p>In a matter of weeks, both Wendy and Cindie told me about book projects they’d been 
      involved with. Apparently, both had contributed to multi-author anthologies where all of 
      the authors contributed not only to the book but also to promoting the marketing of the 
      book through their social connections online.</p>

    <p>As soon as I heard about these projects, I wondered, <em>Would it be possible to use the 
      same technique to promote our LOA Today podcast?</em></p>

    <p>Within a couple more weeks, I became obsessed with the idea of doing an anthology style 
      book sharing personal manifestation stories with as many students of the Law of Attraction 
      as we can find. These would be real stories told by real-life people in the LOA field from 
      their own life experiences.</p>

    <p>I imagined it to be an LOA version of Jack Canfield’s world-famous <em>Chicken Soup For 
      The Soul</em> series of books. No one needs positive reinforcement and confidence building 
      more than “deliberate creators” attempting to leverage the Law of Attraction in their daily 
      lives. What better way to get such leverage than from the real-life experiences of others 
      who are equally devoted to studying and applying this marvelous universal law?</p>

    <p>You hold the result in your hands.</p>

    <p>I’ve organized the book into sections, to make it easy for readers to find particular 
      kinds of stories. You can find stories about manifesting new homes and offices, 
      relationship, careers, improved health, new cars, and even the weather.</p>

    <p>You will find a wide range of perspectives in the enclosed stories. Perspective is a 
      key concept in LOA, and it plays no less of an important role here. So many perspectives, 
      39 in all, came together to create such a great book.</p>

    <p>So you’ll find stories that range from really happy, light-hearted pieces such as Keisha
      Clark’s “My Birthday Bath”, to the dark, blunt, and even brutal experiences detailed by
      Misti Jackson-Derringer in her story, “Boot Camp”.</p>

    <p>You’ll find stories where the main players didn’t even know how LOA worked, side-by-side 
      with stories from experienced practitioners who knew exactly what they wanted to attract 
      and how to do it deliberately.</p>

    <p>The stories range from being locked in a garage and using our inner voice to get out, 
      to following one’s nose all the way out to an oceanic adventure.</p>

    <p>The emphasis on what’s important varies considerably from story to story, just as the 
      voices of the different authors also vary. </p>

    <p>Some stories emphasize the internal self-talk and self-listening. Others emphasize 
      physical talk and actions. Some emphasize theory, while others emphasize feeling your way.</p>

    <p>But they all have one thing in common. They are all stories of things, experiences, and 
      events that occurred by thinking and feeling about them <strong>first</strong>.</p>

    <p>The Law of Attraction always operates in everything that comes into our lives. This book 
      not only recognizes that fact but also plays up stories where LOA’s role is clear.</p>

    <p>The main criteria that your editor used when putting the book together was to make the 
      book a collection of stories. Our purpose here is to entertain and inspire rather than to 
      teach. We hope you agree that this is really the best way to hear other peoples’ stories.</p>

    <p>On behalf of all the authors of this book, I hope you’ll find this book is a bright light 
      in your daily life. Perhaps it will take a place on your coffee table for you to read for 
      a bit whenever you need a pick-me-up. Or perhaps it will adorn your bedside table, giving 
      you some happy thoughts before you go to sleep at night.</p>

    <p>Just like what we say about the LOA Today podcasts, we hope that his book becomes Your 
      Daily Dose of Happy, one that not only provides you with inspiration and reinforces your 
      belief in yourself and in what you want most to manifest into your life, but also gives 
      you something you are eager to share with friends and families.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>I want to thank all of the people who have played roles both in the creation of this 
      book and in helping me to develop the LOA Today podcast over the years. Hopefully, I 
      don’t leave anyone out. If I do, please accept my apologies.</p>

    <h5>Home Sweet Home<br />
    by Wendy Dillard</h5>

    <p>After living in many rental properties, I’d had all I could stand of white-colored 
      walls and boring color palettes that rentals provided. So, it wasn’t any surprise to 
      me that I’d been dreaming of my own house where I would have the luxury of painting 
      the walls and decorating it in every conceivable way that my artistic heart desired. 
      Living in a space that reflected my colorful personality felt like the kind of nurturing 
      environment that would nourish my soul.</p>

    <p>When we were financially ready to buy a house, I performed an analysis of home prices 
      around our city and landed on the target area where we could get the most square footage 
      for the lowest price.</p>

    <p>Even though this would be my first house, I didn’t want a typical 3 bedroom / 2 bath 
      starter home because when I want something, I dream BIG! I really wanted 5 bedrooms, 
      but realistically 4 bedrooms was more in line with our budget. </p>

    <p>Since I had been planning for my first house for a long time, I’d developed a pretty 
      long list of criteria, needs and wants. So, here’s an abbreviated list:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Five bedrooms (which included: a master suite, a guest room, a workroom for me to do 
        my many artistic projects, my office, and a separate office for my husband so we wouldn’t 
        have to share an office anymore. I’m a highly organized neat-freak, and he loves his piles 
        and piles of stuff scattered about everywhere)</li>
      <li>Two to three bathrooms</li>
      <li>An open-concept floor plan</li>
      <li>A nice yard for our dog</li>
      <li>A long and flat driveway that could park a minimum of six cars. (My husband loved to 
        tinker with cars and always had a number of non-running vehicles that he was in the 
        process of restoring. Our current rental house gave birth to this criteria because even 
        though the driveway could hold four cars, the driveway was pitched at a 45 degree angle. 
        It took me forever just to have the courage to drive up or down this steep, monster-like 
        driveway. We ended up replacing the brakes on our cars practically every six months! So, 
        between our personal cars and the ones that my husband was working on, we knew we wanted 
        lots of space to park our cars, and it had to be on a flat surface.)</li>
      <li>We wanted it to be at a price that we could comfortably afford, so we wouldn’t feel
        that every dollar we earned went toward the mortgage.</li>
      <li>And it had to be no-money down!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Needless to say, the list was long. But, my life’s experience had taught me that no dream 
      was too big for God (or the Universe) to deliver.</p>

    <p>As the house-hunting began, we found the four-to-five bedroom houses in our price range 
      were completely unacceptable, which left us feeling melancholy. We thought we might need 
      to compromise or settle for less than what we wanted, causing all the air in our lofty 
      balloon to deflate. My hope of finding my dream home took a huge blow. What do you do 
      when you believe your dream is out there somewhere, but you don’t see any evidence of it? </p>

    <p>A number of months went by. I thought maybe the latest inventory of houses on the market 
      could possibly provide better options. So with renewed energy and vigor, I went back to 
      searching. </p>

    <p>This time we still found a bunch of duds, but the last house on the list showed promise. 
      It was a black-and-white brick, one-story, four bedroom, two bathroom house. The flat 
      driveway wasn’t particularly long, but because of where the house was situated at the end 
      of street, it could work. </p>

    <p>The inside of the house was darling. It checked almost all the boxes on our list. It was 
      in super-duper, wonderful condition. There weren’t any dings or dents in the walls or doors
      (like we saw in the other houses). The back yard was small, but it was beautifully 
      landscaped and definitely appealed to the artist in me. </p>
    
    <p>Overall, the house made my heart smile. Both of us could easily picture ourselves here. 
      While heading home, our excitement was almost uncontainable as we chatted on and on about 
      its attractive curb appeal, charming interior, wonderful floor plan, pristine landscaping, 
      and spacious area for cars. </p>

    <p>We floated on Cloud Nine with smiles fixed indelibly on our faces.</p>

    <p>The only glitch was that we needed $2,000 for a down-payment (which we didn’t have), 
      but we thought for certain that either his parents or mine would happily loan it to us. 
      We knew his parents had the money, so contacting them felt like a formality. </p>

    <p>With a feeling of “this was a done-deal,” my husband called them by phone while I stood 
      close by with great anticipation and a readiness to celebrate. His smile quickly changed 
      to a somber expression. The call was brief. They said “No.” They had a reason as to why 
      the money was not available, but the reason faded as I focused on the shock that they 
      wouldn’t lend us the money for the down-payment.</p>

    <p>We moved on to the backup plan of asking my parents for the money. With the sale of my 
      grandma’s home after she passed on, I knew they had a large amount of cash in the bank. 
      I knew this was a conversation that required me reaching out to my Dad (because he was 
      the decision-maker). He hated talking on the phone, but loved email. </p>

    <p>So, I promptly typed up an email using all the sweetness, charm, and “you love your 
      daughter, don’t you?” wording I could think up. Then we waited ... </p>

    <p>Day One, no response ... </p>

    <p>Day Two, no response ...</p>

    <p>We were practically out of our minds with impatience while waiting for a response from 
      my dad. My thoughts turned to fears as I pictured someone else snatching up the 
      black-and-white brick house. It was not easy to keep calm. I kept reminding myself that 
      IF this was to be our house, that it would be &ndash; and my dad’s delayed response wouldn’t be 
      a problem. </p>

    <p>Finally on Day Three, my inbox held the response from my dad. I’ll never forget his words: </p>
      <blockquote>“After much prayer, your mother and I don’t feel we are to loan you the money. 
        We wish you all the best in finding a new house.”</blockquote>
    
    <p>OMG! This was not at all what we’d expected. Our hearts sank to an all-time low. I re-read 
      his email over and over. I couldn’t believe my dad’s words. But, knowing their religious 
      beliefs, if God had told them “No,” there was no overturning their decision.</p>

    <p>With no other resources available to us, our plans to live in the black-and-white brick 
      house died. We wallowed in anger, sadness, and grief for the next several days as the 
      realization settled in that we’d lost this house.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, after a few days of releasing much pain and sadness, the cheerful, optimistic 
      side of me buoyed back to the surface. I felt an unanticipated surge of knowingness permeate
      my entire being with this inspiring thought: If not this house, then what’s in store for us 
      must be even better!</p>

    <p>With that, I felt jubilantly refreshed as my vision of my dream house was reinvigorated. 
      I knew with every ounce of my being that the house actually awaiting us would be even 
      grander than the black-and-white brick house, because what was yet to show up would truly 
      be The House.</p>

    <p>That thought was so powerful within me, it held me in a sense of hope for an entire year. 
      One day, I felt the nudge to hit the Internet again in search of our house. This time I 
      went into it knowing the exact suburb that would give us the biggest bang for our buck, 
      so that’s where I concentrated my efforts.</p>

    <p>One day, I found a house on April Showers Way that perfectly fit my search criteria. 
      I thought, <em>How cute is that street name?</em></p>

    <p>I could totally live on a street called, “April Showers Way.”  I decided to check it 
      out on my own, so as not to get my husband’s hopes up if it turned out not to be a good 
      option.</p>

    <p>I printed my MapQuest directions, and off I went. When I found the address, I thought 
      to myself: <em>Something about this house doesn’t seem right.</em> The description online 
      was for a two story house, and this was only one story. Feeling misled by whoever wrote 
      up the description, I drove around the neighborhood to see if there would be anything 
      else for sale</p>

    <p>I meandered through the streets of this subdivision where I found a group of six model 
      homes. I went in to check them out. Each one was beautifully staged with furniture, décor, 
      and impeccable landscaping. As I walked through each home, my enthusiasm grew while my 
      artistic-self resonated with the attractive décor. I was in heaven!</p>

    <p>As I opened the front door to this two story, five bedroom house, feelings of fairy 
      tale-like enchantment enveloped me. This enormous house was so big, I actually got lost 
      in it (true story). </p>

    <p>When I walked up the stairs, I couldn’t help but wonder what this house might cost and 
      if it was anywhere within our price range. I strolled from room to room. The master 
      suite’s entrance had two French doors that majestically opened up into the large master 
      bedroom. Even with a king-size bed, there was plenty of space for this room to have a 
      feeling of being absolutely grand.</p>

    <p>Surprisingly, as I walked all the way to the end of the bedroom expecting to find the 
      Bathroom area, I found yet another room that could perhaps be used as a secluded room for 
      reading. </p>

    <p>Tears began to stream down my cheeks as I was filled with an overwhelming flood of joy. 
      This magnificent house was more perfect than I’d ever pictured in all of my imaginations 
      about my dream house. I felt deep within me that I’d come home. There was something about 
      that extra room within the master suite that filled me with feelings of royalty and 
      grandeur like I’d never experienced. It was the icing on the top of my dream-house cake! 
      My tour ended with an enormously sized bathroom, followed by a huge walk-in closet 
      (the size of another bedroom).</p>

    <p>Wiping the tears from my eyes, I pulled out my cell phone to call my husband. He worked 
      nearby, and quitting time was coming soon. I told him I was in the area looking at homes, 
      and asked him to meet me at the model home sales office, because I wanted him to view the 
      model homes. I did my best not to blurt out anything that would broadcast my extreme 
      excitement because I wanted him to have his own experience.</p>

    <p>I walked behind him as he toured the model homes, trying to be as quiet as a mouse so as 
      not to influence him in any way. When he came to the one I’d fallen in love with, he 
      became enthusiastically more vocal about the things he liked. By the time he reached the 
      master suite, he too fell in love with this model as much as I did.</p>

    <p>How’s that for synchronicity and like-mindedness?</p>

    <p>With a particularly large bounce in our steps, we headed off to the sales office. While 
      there, I picked up the sales sheet with the description of the “Chanticlair” Model that 
      we loved. I laughed because it was the exact description of the house on April Showers 
      Way that brought me to this subdivision. I love how guidance doesn’t always come in the 
      package I expect, but the path is always laid out for me.</p>

    <p>The prices were higher than we’d hoped &ndash; big ouch! But, we still talked the salesman’s 
      ear off with our joyful enthusiasm for making a purchase, and we simply acted as though 
      we could afford the model we loved. We left there knowing we’d have to do some creative 
      financing, but we felt “sold” on that model.</p>

    <p>The next weekend was New Year’s Day, and we drove out to the sales office to talk more 
      seriously about locking down one of the pieces of property upon which to build our new 
      home. We thought for sure the sales office would be open to do business, but we were 
      wrong. The office was closed.</p>

    <p>Because we felt such a powerful desire to go there, we thought maybe the purpose of the 
      trip was to drive through the development to select the property we’d build upon. Most of 
      the properties had the driveways either poured or measured-out with stakes. Shockingly, 
      these driveways were tiny &ndash; barely one car length long. The longest was one-and-a-half car 
      lengths long &ndash; definitely not what we were expecting. This meant that none of the available 
      properties would work for us.</p>

    <p>We were back to feeling disappointed and a bit hopeless. This seemed like yet another case 
      of getting our hopes really high, only to have them dashed. </p>

    <p>How was this possible?</p>

    <p>I was once again reminded of the powerful thought: “If not this house, then what’s in store 
      for us must be even better!” </p>

    <p>This encouraged us only slightly. </p>

    <p>While in our saddened state, we drove around the neighborhood next to this new 
      development. I couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw the Chanticlair home in an already 
      developed neighborhood with a "for sale" sign in the front lawn. Could this be real? </p>

    <p>As we looked for a place to park the car, we found yet another Chanticlair home with 
      a "for sale" sign. </p>
    
    <p>Were we in a Twilight Zone episode? It sure felt like it.</p>

    <p>efore we dared to get excited, we drove through the alley where we could see the lengths 
      of the driveways. Astonishingly, the first driveway was about four car lengths long, and 
      the second one was five car lengths long!</p>

    <p>We couldn’t help ourselves. Our hopes sky-rocketed once again. Right before us were two 
      Chanticlairs with long driveways already in existence, and they were for sale.</p>

    <p>We called the listing agents on each of the "for sale" signs. The first house had just 
      sold. The second house was still available, so we scheduled a meeting to see it. When we 
      physically walked into the house, we knew this was truly the one.</p>

    <p>This house was incredibly perfect. It met all the criteria on our list with a few bells 
      and whistles thrown in. The sales price was within our budget, which was lower than the 
      new construction home, and we could buy it with no money down!</p>

    <p>We celebrated by dancing with joy because this house was beyond what we’d ever thought 
      possible. It had our five bedrooms, three bathrooms, and three living rooms. It had an 
      open concept kitchen looking into the living room, and the walls beckoned the brush of 
      my artistic stroke as I envisioned the beautiful colors that would make my heart sing.</p>

    <p>We went home, got all of our ducks in a row financially, and planned to put our offer 
      on the house the next Saturday.</p>

    <p>On Friday before my work day came to an end, I was unexpectedly called into the HR 
      office. Without any warning, I was told that my job had been eliminated. It felt surreal 
      like I was in a movie with a major plot twist. The HR lady continued to speak, but I 
      could barely hear her over the sounds of my own thoughts racing about how this would 
      impact the purchase of our house. </p>

    <p>I didn’t know what to think or what to feel. I felt certain we’d been guided to our 
      house &mdash; and now this? </p>

    <p>When I called my husband from the car to tell him what had just happened, he said 
      with a sad tone of voice, “I guess we won’t be able to buy the house.” </p>

    <p>To which I replied with powerful intensity: “Oh, no &ndash; this is not going to stop us! 
      We found our house, and we’re going to put on offer on it tomorrow as planned.” </p>

    <p>aturday, we met our Realtor and took one more walk through the house drinking in the 
      feeling of being at home. Standing at our soon-to-be kitchen counter, we quickly agreed 
      on the amount we would offer. </p>

    <p>As the Realtor wrapped up the discussion, he asked if we had any questions. </p>

    <p>“Well, there’s one thing. I lost my job yesterday. Will that be a problem?” </p>

    <p>He looked up toward the ceiling and pondered as he composed his answer. </p>

    <p>When he was ready, he looked directly at me and said, “Well, in my 25 years as a 
      Realtor, I’ve dealt with worse circumstances. So your job will be to get a job before 
      the closing.” </p>

    <p>I loved how my job circumstances didn’t derail him, and it definitely gave me the 
      encouragement to go forth and land a new job!</p>

    <p>Our offer was accepted, and we were ecstatic. We’d finally found our dream home. 
      We were relieved that this arduous search had finally come to an end. </p>

    <p>For the next six weeks, I didn’t allow myself to focus on anything except finding 
      a new job. I was in the final round of interviews for a job that would pay about the 
      same salary as my previous job, and it looked good. While driving there, a headhunter 
      from another company called saying that he’d already shared my resume with his client, 
      and they felt I was perfect for the job. I told him that I was really close to securing 
      a job, as I was literally driving to the final interview, but this headhunter was 
      persistent and begged me to call him anyway when I exited the interview.</p>

    <p>When I walked into the final interview at the dairy company, they informed me that the 
      company prioritized hiring from within. They had just learned of an associate desiring 
      to transfer to this office, so they gave her the job. </p>

    <p>As much as I was disappointed, I also felt relieved. Even though I needed a job ASAP, 
      I didn’t really want that one. It didn’t feel challenging enough to hold my interest for 
      long. </p>
    <p>I called the headhunter from the other company. He was right. His client loved me. After 
      one of the easiest interviews I’d ever had, they hired me on the spot. And guess what? 
      The salary was significantly higher than the dairy company. With this salary, we’d have 
      a financial cushion so we wouldn’t just be working to pay the bills, fulfilling another 
      criteria on our list.</p>

    <p>I immediately called our Realtor and told him the good news. He was delighted. I told 
      him that I would start my new job just in time for the paperwork to be drawn up for the 
      closing to happen on time. Closing day went off without a hitch. Whew! We drove around 
      our new city looking for a place for us to have lunch and bask in the joy of 
      home-ownership.</p>

    <p>While directing our movers as they carried our furniture into our new house, I could 
      barely contain my exuberance. This house filled me with such incredible joy. Even after 
      11+ years of living in it, I still get giddy about its perfection. </p>

    <p>We got everything that was important to us about a house. Thank goodness that knowing 
      the ins-and-outs of the Law of Attraction was not necessary for it to show up in our 
      experience, because at the time we didn’t know about Law of Attraction. </p>

    <p>Knowing what I know today, I can see in hindsight how the Law of Attraction coordinated 
      all necessary elements to deliver to us exactly what we desired with a synchronicity I 
      could have never orchestrated. My strong desire and never-give-up attitude played a large 
      role in landing our dream home. And as Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz said, “There’s no 
      place like home.”</p>

    <h5>The Lot<br />
    by Barbara Pinti</h5>

    <p>In 1978 our family of six was too big for our house.</p>

    <p>We had loved living on the last road cut into the side of a mountain.  During nice 
      weather our family had hiked through the woods up that mountain to see the white-tailed 
      deer.  With three of our kids walking and one in a pack on our backs, we loved to 
      explore the area.</p>

    <p>One day we had found a huge sprawling rock formation and decided to have our picnic 
      lunch there.  It became “our” rock and a favorite place to rest and eat after hiking.</p>

    <p>But our house was too small, and our family was growing. It was time to move. </p>

    <p>We searched for our new “family home” where we would raise our children to adulthood.  
      We took several trips through town looking for that perfect house.  Finding nothing after 
      several months, we thought about building one ourselves so we could have all the things we 
      wanted in our ideal house.  </p>

    <p>A builder in a nearby town put up some larger homes, and we went to look at them.  He 
      had a few different house plans, and there were some lots available.  We started getting 
      excited about it, chose a lot, and selected a plan.  </p>

    <p>The house took forever to build. We visited the site daily to check on progress. </p>

    <p>One day, we were very upset to find that the builder had switched the floor plan to be 
      the opposite of what we had planned.  It was very disappointing, but there didn’t seem 
      to be anything possible to be done about it as the foundation was already poured. </p>

    <p>We accepted the disappointment.  About a week later we found another problem.  The 
      fireplace was done, and it was amateurish, awful, completely unacceptable.   I remember 
      at the time we said it looked like a kindergartner had built it.</p>

    <p>A decision had to be made.  I no longer wanted the house.  It had become a disaster 
      project instead of a joyous one.  After consulting our lawyer, we found we were able 
      to get out of the commitment. </p>

    <p>So after all this time, we found ourselves right back again at step one.  We began 
      to search again for that house that would make my heart flutter.</p>

    <p>We learned that lots were being forged out of the road further up our mountain.  
      We took a ride up the mountain to see what was going on up there. </p>

    <p>Nothing had been built yet, but all of the lots were marked off. We checked them out. 
      As we perused the lots,  one lot seemed very familiar.  It included a large rock with 
      some of the same parts that I had remembered from our picnics.  However much dirt 
      covered parts of the rock, so it took a while for us to realize that it was indeed “our” 
      rock. </p>

    <p>That was it!  We wanted that lot!  We started getting excited about the possibility 
      of building on that site where our footprints had tread while our joys and laughter 
      had rung out.</p>

    <p>Finding the builder’s number on a sign nearby, we went right home and called him up.  
      Our disappointment was profound when he told us that all of the lots had been sold.  
      I was crushed at first, but I remembered other times during my life when I thought all 
      was lost.</p>

    <p>I began imagining the house that we would build on that property and all the fun that 
      the children would have playing in the woods.  I even planned out just where I would 
      locate my garden.  I walked the land and scoped it all out as though it were mine.</p>

    <p>I confided to several friends how much I wanted that building lot and continued to hope 
      beyond hope that it could be ours. Every night before sleep, I would imagine all of us 
      snug in the house that we had built on that property.  I pictured us playing outside 
      around the rock while laughing and enjoying ourselves completely.  I felt as though I 
      had claimed that property as our own, not only then, but years earlier as well.</p>

    <p>A few weeks later, a miracle happened.  I spoke to a friend who had been bowling that 
      morning with the woman who owned “our” lot.  The woman confided that her husband had 
      just been offered a new and better job in another state.   They needed to sell the lot 
      as quickly as possible.</p>

    <p>Events moved very fast now.  We bought the lot from them in a quick, private sale.  
      I worked feverishly designing our new home.  We found a builder.</p>

    <p>One of the first things we asked him to do was to remove the dirt from the rock so 
      that it looked exactly like it did in the days when we picnicked on it.</p>

    <h5>Manifesting an Apartment on Central Park West<br />
    by David Scott Bartky</h5>

    <p>Many years ago before I became a professional life coach, I moved from Los Angeles to 
      New York. While in Los Angeles, I learned about the Law of Attraction from Michael 
      Beckwith many years before he appeared in the movie, <em>The Secret</em>. </p>

    <p>When I moved to New York City, I became part of the masses who raced to see any new 
      apartment listing. Since I didn’t have a large budget, most of the apartments I ran to 
      ended up being very disappointing. They were either too small or had some weird quirk 
      about them that for me made them undesirable.</p>

    <p>After many of these cattle call type experiences, I suddenly had an “ah ha” moment. 
      I remembered the Law of Attraction and how powerful it is. I thought to myself, “Why am 
      I looking at these apartments all over New York City when I always dreamed about living 
      on Central Park West?” I thought this despite the fact that my budget didn’t qualify for 
      an apartment on one of the nicest streets in New York City. So in an instant I went from 
      an “I’ll take anything” attitude to an “I know exactly what I want, and that’s all I’m 
      interested in!” attitude. How could my dream of rollerblading from my apartment building 
      into Central Park become a reality?</p>

    <p>I learned from Beckwith that what I focus on is what I attract. I didn’t have to know 
      how it would happen. I just had to get into the vibration of what I wanted and expect it 
      to happen. </p>

    <p>After my wonderful “ah ha” moment, I called my Realtor and told him, “Don’t let me know 
      about anything unless it’s on Central Park West.” Silence on the other end of the phone 
      told me he thought I was crazy. After the silence he said, “Well, that’s a tall order, 
      but I’ll keep my ears open.” I thanked him, and I never looked at another “for rent” ad 
      again. I just trusted that it would happen and went about my business. Within two weeks 
      I received a phone call from that Realtor about a studio apartment coming available in a 
      building on Central Park West. It was $500 more than what I could afford. He asked me if 
      I was interested. I didn’t hesitate: “YES!”</p>

    <p>Why did I agree to go look at an apartment that was $500 more than I could afford? 
      Because I know that anything is possible, so why not look at it? I met him outside the 
      building. The lobby was so nice it took my breath away. The elevator was the nicest one 
      I had ever been in. It had oriental birds painted on the walls. I was ready to move in 
      before I saw the apartment! </p>

    <p>We walked into the apartment. I knew it was perfect for me. The tenant, who wasn’t 
      supposed to be home, was gathering some things. I asked her why she was moving. She told 
      me her mother was ill, and she had to go back home to care for her. She also said I was 
      the first one to see the apartment and that since she was breaking the lease, the owner 
      didn’t want it to sit empty. I got the nerve up to ask her how much she was paying per 
      month. She told me, and it was exactly what I could afford!</p>

    <p>I guess the owner was told she could charge $500 more, so that’s why she raised the 
      price. However, since I knew what the current tenant was paying I told the building 
      manager that I wanted the apartment, and I offered $25 more than what the current tenant 
      was paying. My Realtor told me that that wouldn’t be enough, but it really was all I 
      could afford, so I asked the building manager to propose my offer to the owner. </p>

    <p>The next day I found out that the owner accepted my offer, and I got the apartment. A 
      few weeks later I moved in. Thank you Law of Attraction. I loved living in that apartment!</p>

    <h5>Our Dream House in Northern California<br />
    by Janet Warnecke</h5>

    <p>In 2015, My husband, Ed and I, after years of living literally in the middle of Hollywood, 
      California, started putting into action our plan of moving to Auburn, California and away 
      from the traffic and the crazies.  We needed to sell our home and improve our credit scores 
      and get all our financial ducks in a row.  We knew we had a slightly long road ahead, but 
      it was certainly doable, and we started doing just that.</p>
      
    <p>That summer, our daughter graduated from the University of California at Santa Barbara but 
      was still living at home and looking to find her way.  What exactly does a degree in German 
      get you? She switched from majoring in history to German because “The German Department is 
      more fun.” Sounded good to us &ndash; fun is better.  Without knowing it, she clearly had her own 
      momentum, but that’s a whole different story.  She is currently working on her Masters degree.  
      So proud!</p>

    <p>We moved to Encino as a pit stop for her to find a job and begin working.  We were not 
      exactly in a position for Ed to give up his job (we were still improving our financial 
      situation). All that time, we constantly discussed what we wanted from the move, i.e., 
      the feeling, the calm, the lack of rush hour traffic, the ability to work from home, 
      neighbors we would actually get to know as opposed to the zillion people surrounding us 
      in condos and apartments. </p>

    <p>We rented a home from a friend in 2015 in Encino.  We moved in and all was going great.  
      Our daughter started working and boom, within a year she met and started a relationship 
      with a very nice guy.  His family was very welcoming and later that year she moved in with 
      him and his family &ndash; all the while continuing to enjoy her job and look into her options.</p>

    <p>Things seemed to be lining up perfectly for my husband and I to make the move to Auburn 
      as we were only planning on staying in Encino for a year and a half.</p>

    <p>In October 2016, my husband was diagnosed with throat cancer, and our whole world changed. 
      Three months of heavy chemo was followed by a short break before handling 37 daily treatments 
      of radiation.  We were devastated.  With Ed in a fight for his life, moving was no longer on 
      the front burner.</p>

    <p>The treatments were brutal.  I was his sole caretaker and had no idea what I was doing.  
      It was truly one minute at a time, one appointment at a time, one pill at a time.  Without 
      going into too much detail, I had never experienced anything so scary.  My husband went 
      from 160 lbs to 112 lbs in three months.  I have no idea how he didn’t fling himself off 
      the roof, except that he was too weak to climb up a ladder.</p>

    <p>With the help of friends and family we made it through.  He had a very good result from 
      the chemo which gave us strength to go forward with the radiation. </p>

    <p>During this time I did not personally think about the house and the move, but my husband 
      told me later that it was constantly on his mind to get through this treatment, so that 
      one way or another we could make it to our dream life.  During most of his treatment he 
      could barely speak, so he did not share this vision with me, but thank God the Universe 
      was listening and that we had been filling that vortex over a lifetime.</p>

    <p>By July 2017. the day after my husband’s radiation treatments ended, our landlords 
      (previously our friends of 30 years) gave us a 30% rent increase.  It was astronomical!  
      Apparently, they wanted to sell the home but had not informed us.  So with this giant 
      increase we decided to move as quickly as possible.  Ed was way too weak to move, but 
      we started taking action to find storage facilities and do whatever we could to go 
      forward.  More importantly, we had gotten the news that the tumors were all gone, and 
      Ed was given a clean bill of health, but it would still take several years to recover 
      fully.  </p>

    <p>Our hopes were high that we would still be able to make our dream come true.  Unbeknownst 
      to me &ndash; and certainly to Ed, because we were so consumed with treatment and appointments 
      and ER visits &ndash; we didn’t pay attention as well as we should have to our financial 
      situation. When we went to apply for a loan, we were told it would take us approximately 
      a year or so to clean things up &ndash; again &ndash; to get a loan.  </p>

    <p>That was it for me.  I cracked.  After getting through the cancer and seeing the light 
      at the end of the tunnel, I was DEVASTATED!  Another year?</p>

    <p>After I sobbed for about three hours that my life was over &ndash; not too self-obsessed or 
      ungrateful for the good things happening, i.e., cancer free &ndash; I got a grip and pulled 
      myself together.  Well, it would take what it takes.  We’re not giving up.  I made a 
      list of what I wanted in a house and started thinking about it again.</p>

    <p>By November we were ready to move, after briefly talking about our “house dreams” with 
      the guys on the LOA Today podcast.  Even with Ed’s low weight and difficult physical 
      condition, we packed and the movers came.  We were out by November 30th, on our way to 
      stay with my father-in-law up north and darn grateful that we had a nice place to stay 
      for Ed to continue to recover and for us to house hunt.</p>

    <p>In December, we saw several homes that first week, but we didn’t have much positive 
      vibration on the actual purchase of a house because we knew we had to improve the 
      financial end.  </p>

    <p>But just being up here, looking at the lake, looking at the trees, the beauty &ndash;
       our vibrations improved whether we had our own house or not.  If it took a year, fine, 
       we were in the most beautiful place on earth for us.  A lot of stress released as we 
       accepted the situation and just enjoyed our surroundings.  </p>

    <p>We suddenly got word that Ed qualified for a VA loan, which opened up a whole new 
      enthusiasm about purchasing a house.  The day after that news, our lender said, “Hmm, 
      your credit score is great, I don’t know what happened.  You can get any loan you need.”  
      We were so jazzed.  Now we just had to find a house.  No pressure though, we thought 
      we’d take the next three or four months to look around.</p>

    <p>On New Year’s Day 2018, we took a walk. It was a gorgeous day.  We decided to go up a 
      street we never take, and there on the corner was a house for sale.  Since it was New 
      Year’s Day we did not expect anyone to be showing the house.</p>

    <p>I had seen this particular house on the MLS listings a month earlier, and it had just
       been sold and was in escrow.  A week before, the previous potential buyer’s offer fell 
       through. </p>

    <p>The agent just happened to be in the house for a private showing as we walked by. We 
      asked if we could take a peek.  She said, “Sure.”  And we fell in love!  We made an offer, 
      and after one day of back and forth, it was accepted.  </p>

    <p>What happened next was also crazy.  It seemed at every step exactly what we needed fell 
      into our lap.  All the paperwork, people who had what we needed – everything! By 
      February 8, 2018, the keys were in our hands!  </p>

    <p>After moving in, about every other day I’d say to Ed things like, “You know, I didn’t 
      notice this when we were looking at the house, but I remembered I always wanted a stream 
      in the backyard – and wow, we have one!”  It was that way with so many things in this 
      house.  So much of my wish list is here.  The Christmas trees out front, the fireplace, 
      the deer and bunnies running around, the lake, the sound of children playing in the 
      neighborhood, my sliding glass doors, French doors, a guest room, a music room, etc.  
      My neighbors brought us welcome cookies. </p>

    <p class="signature">Here’s the original wish list:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Fireplace In Every Room – <strong><em>Got one in the living room</em></strong></li>
        <li>3 Bedrooms, Office Space, Guest Room – <strong><em>Got it</em></strong></li>
        <li>At Least 1800 Sq Ft – Would Have Accepted Less – <strong><em>Got it</em></strong></li>
        <li>Trees – Amazing Views – <strong><em>Got it</em></strong></li>
        <li>Close To My Father-In-Law – <strong><em>Got it (three minute walk)</em></strong></li>
        <li>Short Walk To The Lake  – <strong><em>Got it</em></strong></li>
        <li>Porch/Deck  – <strong><em>Got it</em></strong></li>
        <li>Backyard The Deer Can’t Get Into For The Cats To Wander – <strong><em>Got it</em></strong></li>
        <li>Good Closet Space – <strong><em>Got GREAT closet space</em></strong></li>
        <li>Two To Three Bathrooms – <strong><em>Got three</em></strong></li>
        <li>Mother-In-Law Suite – Saw several in the MLS and thought it would be a great thing 
          to have. There are not that many homes here with that situation, but i still wished for 
          it – did not expect it in a million years. – <strong><em>Got three</em></strong></li>
        <li>Deer And Bunnies And Blue Birds – <strong><em>Got them</em></strong></li>
        <li>Super Cozy Feeling – <strong><em>Got it</em></strong></li>
        <li>Good Size Kitchen – <strong><em>Got it, nice and bright too!</em></strong></li>
        <li>White Kitchen – <strong><em>Got it</em></strong></li>
        <li>Decent Size Parcel Of Land – <strong><em>Got it, one-half acre</em></strong></li>
        <li>Double Front Door – <strong><em>Got it, couldn’t believe it</em></strong></li>
        <li>Sliding Glass Doors/French Doors – <strong><em>Got French doors in the bedroom</em></strong></li>
        <li>Great Back Yard – <strong><em>Got it</em></strong></li>
        <li>Garage with space/shelves and could actually fit the car – <strong><em>Got it</em></strong></li>
        <li>Indoor Laundry – Last one was outside – hated that – <strong><em>Got a whole laundry 
          room with counters and sink. Amazing!</em></strong></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Plus, there were more things we didn’t even think of for our wish list that showed up 
      anyway, like a built-in sprinkler system and a golf cart.</p>

    <p>This DOES NOT HAPPEN in the middle of Hollywood! Apparently, all the years of putting 
      different thoughts on what we wanted our home and lives to look like were all piling up 
      in the vortex.  I like to think that while Ed was going through this time, OUR home was 
      being prepared to be put on the market. </p>

    <h5>Divorced, Broke and Homeless<br />
    by Mike McEwen</h5>

    <p>That's where I was in 2013, the result of 20 years of trying to make everyone else 
      happy but myself. I guess this is what it takes to "wake up" and be responsible for 
      your own happiness. </p>

    <p>Looking back on it today, I am very grateful for all the failures and the lessons I 
      learned, which helped me to write this story in the hope that I can inspire someone 
      who's going through something similar. When one gets caught up in life’s circumstances, 
      it's like being trapped in a revolving door of lack. The Law of Attraction gave me 
      plenty of opportunities to continue feeling all that I lacked. I eventually realized 
      that the one thing I lacked most was happiness.</p>

    <p>My divorce was finalized July 28, 2013. On August 1st, I arrived in Phoenix, Arizona 
      to visit my daughter, son-in-law, and two grandkids for a healing vacation. For the 
      first time in a long time, I felt like I was moving forward, and I was so grateful to 
      be with my Arizona family. I arrived back in Connecticut in late August refreshed and 
      feeling loved and appreciated ... something I hadn't felt in a long time.</p>

    <p>I was still homeless but not broke. A good friend of mine invited me to stay at his 
      house until I could get my own apartment. John likes big bonfires, and I arrived one 
      Friday evening to find him building one.</p>

    <p>It gave us a great opportunity to sit around the fire and drink some beer, so we did. 
      Around the fourth beer, I decided to burn all of the old negative past paperwork and 
      anything linked to my unhappiness. I made the intention to connect with new people with 
      similar interests. </p>

    <p>Oh what a great night that was! I had no idea what was about to happen. </p>

    <p>Sitting at the kitchen table the next morning having coffee, I decided to go online 
      to check out some events. I found a meditation group meeting that afternoon in the 
      town where I grew up and decided to attend. After the meeting, I talked with the 
      facilitator of the meditation group, telling her that I would like to find more 
      events to attend so I could meet more positive, like-minded people, and she recommended 
      I check out a website called Meetup.com.</p>

    <p>Back at my friend’s house that afternoon, I decided to go online to check out the 
      Meetup.com site. I typed in “local events.” The first thing that popped up was Laughter 
      Yoga at The Buttonwood Tree. So without hesitation I signed up for it. Not only did 
      Laughter Yoga teach me how to laugh at things that would normally upset me, I met 
      the director of The Buttonwood Tree, Anne-Marie, and it didn't take long before a 
      strong connection grew between us ... something that hadn't happened in a long time. 
      She asked me out for tea.</p>

    <p>I replied, "It's 9:00 at night. How about a beer?" </p>
    <p>In conversation over a few beers we found that we had a lot in common, so I invited 
      her to sunrise Tai Chi that next morning. I was happy that she showed up. After Tai 
      Chi we went out for breakfast. It was a wonderful start to a new relationship. </p>

    <p>Before I knew it, we had a dinner date. The food and the conversation were great as 
      we sat overlooking Lake Pocotopaug at Angelico's Lake House Restaurant. </p>

    <p>What a great manifestation!</p>

    <p>Several days after our dinner date she handed me a key to her apartment. Hesitating 
      at first, I realized here was another manifestation: no longer homeless and no longer 
      alone. As we say in Laughter Yoga, "Very Good Very Good Yay!" </p>

    <p>After living with her for about a year, the landlord sold the house, and we had to 
      move out … in three weeks! Oh no! At that time, my contracting business was slow, and 
      money was real tight. How could we find a place to live in three weeks?</p>

    <p>Intend it to be and it shall be. My then fiancée just kept saying,  "No worries … the 
      right place to move into will show up at the right time.”</p>

    <p>Okay, I thought, but where's the money going to come from? If we feel abundant when 
      there seems like there's nothing to feel abundant about, the universal Law of Attraction 
      matches the feeling with more of the same. People, circumstances, and events line up at 
      the right time … and that's what happened. </p>

    <p>Anne-Marie called a Realtor whom she worked with in the past and received a lead on a 
      single-family house for lease that she <em>thought</em> might be available but wasn’t 
      sure. Anne-Marie investigated and found that it was the perfect little house for us.</p>

    <p>We had five days to sign the lease, but we didn't have the $3,000 we needed up front 
      for it. </p>

    <p>I had sold a contracting job that would yield us enough money, but it would take 30 days 
      to complete the job and get paid. Three days before signing the lease, I received a call 
      from the management company for the construction project. The bank had taken over their 
      property, creating a very unusual situation because they had to close out all the 
      accounts for that property. He requested that I send my invoice for the job even though 
      I hadn’t started so he could pay me in full to get it off the books for the sum total 
      of $9,600!</p>

    <p>Problem solved. I still can’t believe it</p>

    <h5>Wouldn’t It Be Cool To Live Here?<br />
    by Stacey Aarssen</h5>

    <p>In 2003, I had spent the last fifteen years working with my parents in a retail 
      clothing store that had grown exponentially over the years. It wasn’t the easiest 
      of tasks to work with parents who didn’t always see my ideas as good ones, although 
      with persistence they would eventually listen. It was a constant battle to be heard, 
      and at the age of 38, I needed a change. </p>

    <p>I did most of the buying for the store. I ran the 4,500 square foot retail space 
      when my parents took the months of January to April off to go to Florida every winter. 
      How would my dad run this place without me? I didn’t want to hurt my dad, and I didn’t 
      know what else to do. I felt smothered, and I couldn’t see a way out. Purchasing the 
      store from my parents was not an option. I couldn’t get the funding and prayed for a 
      way out of this box.</p>

    <p>A few months later, my husband and I took an exciting trip to Elora for a week of 
      camping with our three beautiful daughters. </p>

    <p>Elora Gorge is a lovely Ontario town with a historic feeling, lovely little shops, 
      and outdoor cafes. Sitting in the outdoor café, we admired the wonderful old buildings 
      while having an amazing conversation.</p>

    <p>I said with a chuckle, “Wouldn’t it be cool to live here?”</p>

    <p>Elora was three hours from our home, and John and I both worked in family businesses. 
      He worked with his dad, and I worked with mine. Wishing to live in this historical 
      little town didn’t really make practical sense.</p>

    <p>Five months later in November, our business celebrated its anniversary. Sadly, there 
      wasn’t much to celebrate. Sales had been declining for months in a clear downward trend.</p>

    <p>Normally November is a celebration of great sales figures. We always had a big sale to 
      kick us off to an amazing holiday sales season. </p>

    <p>This year was different. The sales were not coming in. </p>

    <p>It created a lot of stress for Dad. He was in his 60’s and really didn’t want to see 
      his retirement lose steam. </p>

    <p>But after some contemplation and research, he decided to run a huge retirement closing 
      sale. </p>

    <p>The sale began that December. The same week we announced the closing of our family 
      business after 28 years, John’s dad’s business announced they were selling his business 
      to a foreign company. Given the uncertainty that comes with new ownership, John and I 
      wondered about his future. </p>

    <p>December turned out to be an extremely busy month in sales for my family’s business. 
      It was the end of an era for our store. Many of our long-time customers were sad to 
      see us close, and at times we wondered if it was the right thing to do. </p>

    <p>But I realized my prayers were being answered. I had prayed for a way out of the 
      business without hurting my dad. I didn’t really know what to do with the result. </p>

    <p>A call came one day from an old friend asking if John was interested in interviewing 
      with a firm located north of Guelph, Ontario. After some contemplation and with an 
      open mind, John decided to go for the interview.  </p>

    <p>The first interview was four long hours, which got him a second interview. After the 
      third interview, John got offered the job. </p>

    <p>Decisions had to be made. Our vision of our life was changing in so many ways. </p>

    <p>We currently lived in a small town where everyone knew each other with lots of family 
      close by. Now, we were moving to a new area. It was exciting and scary, all in the 
      same breath. </p>

    <p>The following weekend, we decided to head north to check out the housing market. When 
      we got to the Fergus area, we discovered how unexpectedly close it was located to Elora.</p>
    
    <p>We called a real estate agent to view a few homes in the area, only to find that there 
      were not many homes matching our wish list. </p>

    <p>One of our most important wants was for the girls all to have their own rooms on the 
      same floor. Most of the homes available had the fourth bedroom in the basement, which we 
      didn’t want. </p>

    <p>The first house we went through was in Elora, a four-bedroom home with all the bedrooms 
      located on the same floor. It was a little bigger than we planned, but it had potential. 
      The view from this house sitting on a hill was spectacular. </p>

    <p>After viewing a few other homes that were okay but didn’t have the energy I was 
      looking for, we all decided the first house we went through in Elora was the one we 
      wanted to buy. </p>

    <p>The amazing part: this house was empty, and it had been on the market for a while. 
      The offer was accepted, and we were the proud new owners of a home in Elora. It was 
      a dream come true.</p>

    <p>Now the planning began to get our home in Wallaceburg on the market. We worked 
      like crazy to make needed repairs to it within a few weeks. </p>

    <p>A close friend of mine mentioned their neighbours’ parents had been looking for a 
      home for the past six months and couldn’t find one. </p>

    <p>We decided to get in contact with them to see if they wanted to see ours. It was 
      exactly what they had been looking for. </p>

    <p>We couldn’t believe it! Our house sold in one day without needing to engage a real 
      estate broker. </p>

    <p>If someone would have said to me six months earlier, “Be careful what you wish for, 
      because dreams do come true,” I would never had believed them. </p>

    <h5>Arizona Dreaming<br />
    by Barbara Pinti</h5>

    <p>In 1995 I took a vacation right after Christmas with a friend of mine.  We spent 
      two weeks in Sedona, Arizona seeing all the sights and doing all the things that 
      tourists do.  </p>

    <p>It was a wonderful two weeks.  Each day we went to one of the popular destinations 
      the area is known for, such as the Grand Canyon,  Cathedral Rock, Oak Creek Canyon, 
      and other places where we could feel the energies that abide there.  </p>

    <p>One of our favorite places was Red Rock Creek.  We drove there each day, gazed at 
      the beautiful rock formations of Cathedral Rock, hiked through the creek, and smelled 
      the wonderful scent of honeysuckle from the many nearby bushes.  I took a sprig of 
      it and put it in my hair so I could smell it all day. </p>

    <p>Red Rock Creek was one of the most photographed places in the old western movies.  
      I remembered the movies I had seen as a girl, recalling Roy Rogers and especially The 
      Lone Ranger.</p>

    <p>One day, instead of continuing around the curve to go to the creek, I took a dirt 
      road straight ahead to explore the area.  I drove about a quarter of a mile and 
      stopped at a perfect view of Cathedral Rock on the left-hand side of the road.  </p>

    <p>To the right I saw the most wonderful house for viewing Cathedral Rock.  I said to 
      my friend, “Now that is the house where I would love to live.  It’s just perfect!”</p>

    <p>During our two week stay, I kept getting a strong feeling that I would come back 
      to Arizona.  The longer I was there, the stronger the feeling became.  I even 
      thought about starting a business there and living there.  I took a four-seat 
      airplane ride over the area, and the sights were just breathtaking!  I truly 
      wanted to spend more time here.  </p>

    <p>Before my trip to Arizona, I had a vision of a large tract of land with a barn 
      with upstairs rooms on the top floor of the barn.  I thought a lot about it as I 
      drove all over Connecticut looking for that barn, sensing I would somehow work out 
      of those rooms. Since I never found that barn, I decided it must have just been my 
      imagination. </p>

    <p>When I returned to Connecticut from Arizona, I spent a great deal of time thinking 
      about living in the southwest.  I began creating in my mind a self-made sabbatical 
      for the summer and spending it in Sedona.  I called one of the healers I visited 
      while vacationing there and inquired whether she knew anyone who could help me with 
      housing.  She gave me a name.</p>

    <p>I started saving money every week and putting it away for my sabbatical. I called 
      the woman whose name I had been given and asked her about renting a place for the 
      summer.  I told her the particulars of what I could afford and the dates of my stay.  
      She told me she would ask around and get back to me.</p>

    <p>While I awaited her response, I kept imagining spending the summer in such a magical 
      place with sunshine every day.  I was enthralled with the red rocks, seeing them in 
      my mind with the sunshine sparkling off them.</p>

    <p>Not long after that, the housing helper called and told me she had a very nice place 
      for me to rent.  She had checked off all the parameters I had given her, spoke to the 
      person who owned the apartment, and left it to us to work out the details.  </p>

    <p>I was very excited and looked forward to the beginning of May when I would take what 
      I thought of as my healing journey.  The leases on both my apartment and my office were 
      up at the end of April, and the classes I taught at the local college ended May 
      9<sup>th</sup>.  Perfect timing!</p>

    <p>I put everything in storage, turned in all my students’ grades, and began what I later 
      called my “moving meditation”.  I drove to Sedona in my little red Honda Civic, windows 
      down, sun roof open, hair blowing in the wind, and loving every moment.  </p>

    <p>That summer is one I will never forget. For the first time I was able to think all my 
      thoughts to completion.  I loved being by myself for the first time in many years.  I 
      listened to my favorite music and the many spiritual and holistic tapes I had collected 
      over the years. </p>

    <p>I spent nine days crossing the country so that I would be able to see the many sights 
      I had read about and so often wanted to visit. During that drive I felt as though I had 
      waited a very long time to do something this important to me.  I spent each day enjoying 
      it to the fullest.  It was a dream coming true. </p>

    <p>I arrived in Sedona early in the day and followed the directions I had been given to 
      the house I was about to rent.  I saw that I was driving on the road I had taken 
      previously to get to Red Rock Creek.  </p>
    
    <p>I kept on looking at the houses, checking them against the address of the house where 
      I would stay.  Each moment of that drive became more and more exciting as I began to 
      think that the house was surely near my favorite spot in all of Sedona.  </p>

    <p>As I kept driving and looking, I found my route taking me down the special road I had 
      explored during my previous visit.  My excitement was paramount now.  Could it be?  
      Could it be the house I had spotted and fallen in love with?  </p>

    <p>Yes!</p>

    <p>The very same house I found during my winter vacation and designated as the “perfect” 
      place to live was the house I rented by phone, not knowing it was the same house! The 
      Law of Attraction had been hard at work bringing me everything I wanted.</p>

    <p>What a wonderful summer! I awoke every morning, hiked to Red Rock Creek, absorbing 
      the breathtaking scenery around me.</p>

    <p>Returning to Connecticut brought some confusion.  I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do or 
      where I wanted to live.  I rented some temporary office space from friends and got back 
      to work meditating on what my future held.</p>

    <p>Within a few months, I decided to open a center for alternative and complementary 
      therapies.  I found a great location for the center, then opened and filled it with 
      therapists doing different holistic modalities.  </p>

    <p>It wasn’t what I had originally imagined, but it was very successful and one of the 
      first of its kind.  This kept me very busy with my own practice, managing the center 
      as a whole, and teaching college.  </p>

    <p>However, there was that one niggling thought, “What about Arizona?”  I just knew there 
      was something more there for me.</p>

    <p>About a year later I returned to Arizona and began to explore the state once more.  
      I didn’t have a clear idea of what I wanted or what I was looking for.  I vaguely 
      thought about finding a ranch where I could open a residential center like the one 
      I founded in Connecticut, one where people would come and stay for several weeks at 
      a time for healing.  But I couldn’t find the right place.</p>

    <p>Feeling confused and discouraged, I returned to Connecticut and decided to put Arizona 
      out of my mind for a while.  However, it wasn’t long before I once again felt strongly 
      that I must return.  </p>

    <p>An old friend who lived in Arizona gave me the name of a Realtor who might be able to 
      help me.  I really liked the first ranch he took me to, but something was holding me 
      back from signing the deal on the lease. Something wasn’t quite right.  </p>

    <p>I’ve learned over the years to pay attention to those feelings and not ignore them.</p>

    <p>There were several out buildings besides the main house and barn.  I spent all day 
      checking things out.  </p>

    <p>Late in the afternoon, I took my last walk around the property still undecided but 
      trying to be realistic about the fact that everything seemed to be just what I wanted.  
      I walked way out beyond the barn into the horse pastures.  </p>

    <p>When I turned around and looked at the back of the barn from that angle, I saw my 
      vision!  It was the barn in the vision I had seen when I was in Connecticut.  It 
      never occurred to me that I would find it here in Arizona!</p>

    <h5>A New Healing Center<br />
    by Clarissa Barraza</h5>

    <p>In April of 2017, I felt a strong need to relocate my office space somewhere I could 
      grow my business even more.</p>

    <p>I easily visualized a gorgeous courtyard entrance with a glassy pool in the center 
      surrounded by lush green palm trees, tropical plants, and plush seating for clients 
      to relax before and after their appointments. Beyond the courtyard, I imagined rooms 
      occupied by a variety of other healers and practitioners services. </p>

    <p>Two nights later, I searched using keywords such as healing centers and spas. To my 
      amazement, I found an announcement of the grand opening of a spa very close to my 
      residence. I got excited when I saw the photograph of the storefront. It showed a 
      beautiful Southwestern stucco building with tall, sunlit, beveled glass windows and 
      doors, elegant Spanish tile, and archways. I knew I had to go view this place! </p>

    <p>As luck would still have it, the location was only ten minutes from my home. After 
      work the following day, I visited the address around dusk. I remembered seeing this 
      building in passing over the years but had never been curious enough to look beyond 
      the driveway. </p>

    <p>I saw a "For Lease" sign at the front of the property. I parked my car and walked 
      around, surveying the environment and even peeping through the windows. </p>

    <p>It was difficult to see inside because the glass was tinted and slightly distorted 
      from the beveling. A maintenance truck with lawn equipment was parked outside, but 
      I didn't see anyone else as I wandered about. </p>

    <p>The driveway was landscaped with manicured sage bushes with long purple blossoms, 
      along with yellow-flowered cacti and agave succulents. It resembled a desert oasis. </p>

    <p>There was a palpable sense of magic in the air. The area was lit with a pinkish, 
      golden yellow and hints of purple. </p>

    <p>A fountain stood at the center of the courtyard, accompanied by more greenery and 
      framed with brick archways all around. Wooden beams rose overhead, and plenty of 
      leisurely seating was spaced throughout the courtyard. </p>

    <p>Surrounding this open area were ten individual office spaces, each with a lovely 
      arched door and windows with etched, beveled glass. Tile entryways enhanced the 
      already picturesque environment. I was astonished. It was just as I envisioned it!</p>

    <p>After a bit, an older gentleman exited one of the vacant offices, so I introduced 
      myself and told him of my interest in leasing a space. He graciously offered to 
      show me all the spaces for lease. </p>

    <p>As we walked, he explained that the doors, windows, and tile were imported from Mexico. 
      He even provided a blueprint of the offices. </p>

    <p>They all seemed so lovely, but they turned out to be too big for me to lease on my own.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, I called the property manager immediately and left my contact information.</p>

    <p>Afterwards, I took photos of the exterior in the evening light. I couldn’t wait to show 
      them to my friends and family! </p>

    <p>If I could gather enough interest, I figured we could share and create our own healing 
      center. But while everyone loved the property, no one was interested in sharing the space.</p>

    <p>I had met Wendy in April 2016 on an Abraham-Hicks land cruise in Cancun. We talked for 
      about three minutes on an elevator. We were both from the Dallas area and quickly 
      exchanged business cards. </p>
    
    <p>Wendy and I did not initially maintain contact after our original meeting, but in November 
      2016 we reconnected at an Abraham-Hicks seminar in Dallas. </p>

    <p>This time we kept in touch, and over the next few months, Wendy kept mentioning that 
      I should meet her friend, Keisha, with whom she said I would have a lot in common. 
      The following April, right around the time that I found my dream office space, Wendy 
      organized a brunch with me and Keisha. </p>

    <p>A few weeks later, I showed the pictures of the office to Keisha. </p>

    <p>She replied “I know this place! I am going to be co-hosting a workshop 
      there in a few months!”</p>

    <p>Instantly, chills ran up and down my body.</p>

    <p>Keisha then offered to introduce me to Christine, who occupied the dream space that 
      would be used for the workshop. Christine and I spoke on the phone, and I liked her 
      immediately. We set up an appointment to meet at the office later that week. </p>

    <p>When I walked in, the office space felt like returning home to a warm hug. The energy 
      was unmistakably healing, and the wonderful atmosphere was decorated so comfortably, 
      complete with healers practicing their modalities and a blissful meditation room. </p>

    <p>I was completely enamored! </p>

    <p>Christine showed me two spaces that were available, and I nearly cried when I saw it. 
      My office. </p>

    <p>It was a spacious room twice the size of anything I had ever had with a stunning window 
      that overlooked the courtyard. </p>

    <p>The environment was perfect for healing work. I knew this was mine. I felt as if it had 
      been waiting for me to show up. </p>

    <p>Needless to say, I moved in immediately. </p>

    <h5>Trapped<br />
    by Esther Bailey-Bass</h5>
    <p>It was a beautiful sunny day in May, with a breeze and a slight chill in the air. 
      I remember it was Monday, May 1, 2017, typical as any other Monday before. </p>

    <p>I readied myself for work, and as I proceeded to leave the house, I turned down 
      the thermostat, set the house alarm, then closed and locked the door behind me. I 
      noticed that I was leaving on time ... in fact, a little early. </p>

    <p>I got into the car, and using the hand remote I opened the garage door and drove 
      the car outside onto the driveway. Again using the hand remote, I closed the garage 
      door. Just as I was pulling away, I noticed the garage door was still open. </p>

    <p>“Huh, that was odd,” I said. </p>

    <p>So, I tried it again, and this time I watched the door close completely, then 
      open again.</p>
    <p>Not wanting to leave home with the garage door open and easy access to tools, 
      lawn mower, yard equipment, bikes and more, I got out of the car to investigate. </p>

    <p>First, I went to the wall unit to close the door from there. The same thing happened. 
      The garage door went up and down and then up again. </p>

    <p><em>Check the sensors,</em> I thought.</p>

    <p>So I did, and they seemed to be aligned. How could I tell? Again, I used the hand 
      remote, the same thing. The wall unit, the same thing – the garage door went up and 
      down and then up again. </p>

    <p>“What!?” I screamed.</p>

    <p><em>I don’t have time for this.</em></p>

    <p>Then I remembered that James, my husband, had adjusted the motor. So I decided 
      I would climb up onto a bench and check the motor. Maybe I could manipulate 
      something there. </p>

    <p>I did, and then again with the hand remote, I pressed the button to open and 
      close the garage door. </p>

    <p>It worked, the garage door was down completely. Now on the inside, I was faced 
      with a dilemma. Do I attempt to open the garage door using the hand remote or 
      wall unit, or would the problem persist? </p>

    <p>I remembered James once told me I could pull the red string to detach the garage 
      door from the motor and then lift the door open manually. </p>

    <p><em>That’s it! That’s what I’ll do.</em></p>

    <p>Something inside me was a little twitchy at this idea but I went for it anyway.</p>

    <p>I pulled the red string and heard a sound of something becoming unhinged. Now 
      I’ll be able to manually open and close the garage door then go onto work. </p>

    <p>Not so fast. </p>

    <p>I went to lift the garage door. I pulled and tugged as hard as could, but it was 
      impossible to move even a little bit. </p>

    <p><em>Wait, I have muscles, I’m not weak. I can do this!</em></p>

    <p>So I tried again, and still not even the slightest budge would the door make.</p>

    <p>I was locked in.</p>

    <p>It was in that moment I realized I was trapped in the garage with no way out. 
      The onset of panic came quickly. Standing in the middle of the garage, nearly in 
      tears, I twirled around like Cinderella.</p>

    <p><em>What just happened? What did I do?</em></p>

    <p>In a panic stricken voice, I said to myself, “Calm down, take a breath, think.” 
      I was going to meditatively coach my way out. </p>

    <p>Yeah, right! That was B.S. </p>

    <p>What could I do? Who could help me? My car, with the keys in the ignition, 
      cell phone and purse on the seat, was on the other side of the garage door. </p>

    <p><em>WTF!</em></p>

    <p>What to do? Well, I did what anyone would do in a similar situation. 
      I screamed and cried for help. </p>

    <p>There was just a sliver of space between the garage door and wall, 
      and through it I screamed for help, calling out, “Neighbor, neighbor help!” </p>

    <p>It seemed utterly useless. </p>

    <p>Looking around the garage for an answer, a way out, I heard sirens in the 
      distance, and that triggered a memory.</p>

    <p>“There’s a phone in here,” I said. </p>

    <p>Immediately, I rushed to search for the cordless phone. I had placed it 
      in the garage for this exact reason. </p>

    <p>I found it, but James had unplugged it. When I plugged it into the outlet it read, 
      “Warning check battery … warning check battery.” </p>

    <p>Surely, it won’t take long to get a charge, and I could call 911 for help. </p>

    <p>While the phone was charging, I got down on my hands and knees and began 
      screaming through the exhaust vent to the neighbor next door.</p>

    <p>“Help, neighbor, help!” </p>

    <p>No one. Nothing. Crickets. </p>

    <p>I went between the cordless phone, the exhaust vent, and garage door screaming 
      for help. </p>

    <p>Then I thought, <em>How can I trip the lock on the interior house door. I’ve seen 
      this done before.</em></p>

    <p>Sure, but it doesn’t work on a deadbolt lock, and I knew that before I even tried, 
      but thought I’d go for it anyway. </p>

    <p>The cordless phone panel kept blinking, “Warning, check battery … warning, check 
      battery.”</p>
    
    <p>I felt a sense of despair that I would be locked in the garage until someone came, 
      perhaps the mailman or James coming home from work. </p>

    <p>Eureka! I’ll dismantle the outside lock of the garage door and use a pole with a 
      rag attached, stick it through the hole to draw attention to passersby. </p>

    <p>So I fashioned a kind of surrender flag and stuck it through the lock hole, waving 
      frantically to no one. Cars would pass by with windows rolled up against the chilly day.</p>

    <p>The UPS truck went speeding by. The next-door neighbor pulled into their driveway but 
      was deaf to my screams. </p>

    <p><em>No phone.</em></p>

    <p><em>No response.</em></p>

    <p><em>No keys.</em></p>

    <p><em>No way out.</em></p>

    <p>I felt a sense of exhaustion take over me, and then I heard: <em>RESIGN</em>.</p>

    <p><em>From what, my job?</em> My body felt exhausted and I surrendered. I had been 
    planning to leave my employment over the past 5 years.</p>

    <p>Pausing to listen, the word settled in me, and I obliged myself to sit down. 
      I pulled up a bench and sat in front of the garage door, looking back and forth 
      asking myself, <em>How does it work?</em> I don’t know how a garage door works. 
      <em>How does it work?</em></p>

    <p>It was like asking a genie in a bottle for a wish.</p>

    <p>Before I could say or hear the word “hands” I sensed them, and there they were, 
      right in front of me. Then I heard, “You can do it,” in a warm, confident, 
      encouraging tone. </p>

    <p>It was a familiar voice. Somehow I knew this voice. It was an aspect of myself 
      from long before college, marriage, and the mundane. </p>

    <p>She was my encourager, a voice of wisdom, clarity, and certainty. I knew her 
      because we had played together before, and I was inclined to follow her lead. 
      So, I reverse engineered my steps. </p>

    <p><em>Hands.</em></p>

    <p><em>What did I do?</em></p>

    <p><em>You did <u>this</u>.</em></p>

    <p><em>When I did that, what happened?</em></p>

    <p><em><u>This</u> happened.</em></p>

    <p>So, I climbed up onto the bench looking for what had detached. Using my hands, 
      I latched two metal arms together. Something in me said, “That’s it, now try.” 
      With the hand remote still in my hand, I stood suspended and pushed the button. 
      Just like magic, the garage door opened. </p>

    <p>Now free, I was dumbfounded. I remember looking at the clear blue sky, uncertain 
      what to do next. I was baffled. So I got in the car and sat for a while before 
      calling work to explain why I would be late. Then I called my mother to tell her 
      what had just happened. After being trapped in the garage for nearly two hours, 
      I ended up being my own rescue. </p>

    <p>Seven months later, I did in fact resign from my employer after nearly 18 years 
      of service. Life on the other side is already proving sweeter.</p>

    <h5>Our Dream Home<br />
    by Linda Armstrong</h5>

    <p>The funny thing about how we manifested our dream home is that I was really FINALLY 
      happy in the home we were living in. I did not plan to move. We lived in a very small 
      Cape Cod style home on a very small lot, about one-eighth of an acre. </p>

    <p>When we purchased that house, we actually had to settle for it. It was the only house 
      we could afford in the town where we really wanted to live. We wanted to live there 
      because the town had a very good school system. </p>

    <p>The house was filthy because of the hoarders who occupied it. So there was a lot to 
      confront. I actually had a knot in my stomach when we made the offer. I was horrified 
      at the thought of living there</p>

    <p>The house was filthy because of the hoarders who occupied it. So there was a lot to 
      confront. I actually had a knot in my stomach when we made the offer. I was horrified 
      at the thought of living there</p>

    <p>I am very interested in Feng Shui, so I had a Feng Shui Master come to the house and 
      do a floor plan for us to make the energy in this house work best for us. Well, after 
      she did a walk through and took some notes, she told us that she saw red ... blood ... 
      and that it would be best if we were to move. Since we could not move, we had her 
      create a Feng Shui plan designed just for us to make the energy work better. </p>

    <p>We rearranged furniture and placed crystals in specific places throughout the house. 
      She told us that we would have to move our front entrance. She said it had to be moved 
      to another side of the house. </p>

    <p>Cape Cod homes generally have a staircase that leads straight out the front door. In 
      this house the entrance had literally three feet between the door and the staircase, 
      just enough space for the door to open. The staircase led straight upstairs into the 
      bathroom … more bad energy. The more she looked around the house, the more bad energy 
      flow she saw.</p>

    <p>We did move the entrance, adding a new foyer. We purchased a really cool carved wood 
      door that had a large sun and moons carved into it. It was such a happy door. I actually 
      miss that door. It set the mood for the whole house. </p>

    <p>I created a custom mosaic floor in the foyer, making it very inviting and improving 
      the house’s energy. We removed walls and opened up the stairway so that it had a wall 
      on only one side. We added a nice iron bed foot board as a see-through railing for the 
      basement. It was quite unique. It really did turn out to be a great little house full 
      of character. </p>

    <p>Always in the back of my mind, I thought that once we renovated the kitchen, we would 
      be able to sell the house and move to a home that we really wanted. We added all new 
      cabinets, granite counter tops, a tiled floor, and a really interesting stone mosaic 
      back splash that pulled out an amethyst color that ran subtly through the granite 
      counter top, which was mostly black with shades of grey. We added all new stainless 
      steel appliances, making the kitchen a wonderful space.</p>

    <p>After seven years of work, we were very happy with the house. We loved this little 
      house that was as different as night from day compared to when we moved into it. 
      I landscaped the whole property myself. I enjoyed doing that as well. </p>

    <p>There was no garage. When we created the new front entrance, we added a large pergola 
      that acted as a carport. We really put a lot of ourselves into that house, adding so 
      much LOVE to it.</p>

    <p>While sitting in my living room with my sister-in-law, she asked me if, now that the 
      house was totally renovated, would we consider moving? She knew I hadn’t been happy 
      when buying it, but she admired the work we had done. Would we want to sell it and 
      move on or stay and love it since it was a really cute and unique home?</p>

    <p>My answer to her was, “The only way we would move is if we found a ranch style home 
      that was contemporary in design. And it would have to be on a large piece of property.” </p>

    <p>And that was that. I didn’t give it another thought. I merely stated what our ultimate 
      dream home would be.</p>

    <p>Then my son, Steele, who always hated school since preschool, asked if he could drop 
      out of school and get his GED. He was miserable in school. We had done Child Study 
      Team each year, but not one of the so-called professionals could ever figure him out. 
      You see, he is very smart. He never fell into any category that would place him with 
      any sort of learning disability. He is a very respectful kid, never got into trouble. 
      But he just hated being in school all day, every day.</p>

    <p>He had a way of outsmarting his teachers, in a respectful way. He would only do the 
      bare minimum of any requirement he was asked to do. The teachers wanted more.</p>

    <p>I had to tell his teachers to be specific when giving him an assignment. If they asked 
      him to summarize a book he read, he would turn in one paragraph that told in a nutshell 
      what the book was about. He had an algebra tutor. Before the tutor could write out the 
      math, he would already have the answer. </p>

    <p>Kids actually do know what is in their best interest. Steele had long used Law of 
      Attraction. He made things go his way without any resistance. </p>

    <p>At first my husband and I were not too thrilled about him wanting to leave school, 
      but Steele was so sure of himself that we decided he knew best.</p>

    <p>Since Steele was leaving school, there was no reason to stay in the town we lived in any 
      longer. Now that there wasn’t anything keeping us there, we decided to look around for 
      another house to live in. Our current house was very nice now, and it would be easy to 
      sell. </p>

    <p>We started looking around and found a nice house on an acre of land. It met most of our 
      requirements except that it was a split level. We put our house on the market. It sold 
      for full asking price, and we then put a bid on this new house, which was accepted. </p>

    <p>Everything was good … until our buyer backed out. Now we had to try to find a new buyer. 
      The house was on the market again, and although everyone seemed to like the house and 
      made nice comments about it, we weren’t getting another offer. And then the seller of 
      the house who had accepted our offer lost patience with us and decided to accept another 
      offer. We lost that house.</p>

    <p>We did then get another offer on our house from a new buyer. This offer was $20,000 less 
      than our asking price, but they were very serious about purchasing it. My husband was in 
      the hospital having hip resurfacing/replacement surgery. As I sat with him in the hospital 
      room, I thought that I might as well start looking for homes in our slightly reduced price 
      range. </p>

    <p>I found a very contemporary-looking ranch on nearly two acres of land. I remembered the 
      conversation with my sister-in-law about my dream home. It seemed perfect. </p>

    <p>We couldn’t wait to go and see it. </p>

    <p>I went to see the house first. A few days later, Gavin could hop around using crutches, so 
      we both went to see the house. We loved it. </p>

    <p>This was the house that we wanted. We made an offer and it was accepted. </p>

    <p>Next came the legal details of purchasing a home. Gavin’s brother and his girlfriend came 
      to visit us from California. They stayed with us for a week. During their stay, they 
      started talking about the Law of Attraction. We had never heard of it before. We were 
      very intrigued. They spoke to us about Abraham-Hicks, and once they were back in 
      California, Gavin’s brother sent us a video clip of the Abraham material. Soon, we were 
      hooked!</p>

    <p>We always thought that everything happens for a reason … that was for sure with us. And 
      always in both of our lives, things always did work out. But, now for the first time we 
      fully realized that we do create our own reality and that the Universe will guide us to 
      our desires as long as we are in alignment with the energy of the desire. </p>

    <p>While we were in attorney review, someone else put in a higher offer on the house that 
      we were in the process of purchasing. While the sellers considered that offer, the buyers 
      of our old house were having some difficulties with their Realtor and their mortgage 
      commitment. It was turning into a real struggle, and at times it didn’t look good, but 
      thankfully we had learned about the power of our thoughts.</p>

    <p>So I started showing appreciation for my current home (I actually miss it even now). 
      I also thought about why I wanted this new house and why I thought I would receive it. 
      I created stories in my mind of living in the new house. I really did A LOT of 
      visualization.</p>

    <p> looked at the listing photos, decorating each room in my mind and creating experiences 
      of living in the new house. I saw us hanging out in the backyard entertaining guests. 
      I sat with these images in the listing and imagined living in the house before we even 
      had the keys. I did this every day. </p>

    <p>I took on the feeling of what it would be like already living there. I did NOT let 
      myself think about it not happening for us, I only thought about how great it will be 
      when we moved in.  I really felt into it. That’s the power of imagination: anything is 
      possible. </p>

    <p>I swam in the energy of living in that home so much that the owners decided to sell it 
      to us and our buyers were able to complete their purchase of our old home. WOW!</p>

    <h5>Treasures From Tikashi<br />
    by Renate Donnovan</h5>

    <p>I lived in a shared accommodation. It was a cute, rented duplex with plush 
      off-white rugs and rustic wood trim on the doors and ceilings. I shared this 
      space with two roommates. </p>

    <p>All three of us were going through divorces or some version of massive 
      “life-restructuring.” These restructurings took the forms of career changes, 
      recovery from financial losses, and ending relationships. </p>

    <p>One of my roommates was a drug addict who created chaos in the house through 
      both a remarkable lack of hygiene (personal and home) and through the unpredictable, 
      Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde behavior he displayed depending on his level of drug-induced 
      high or withdrawal. </p>

    <p>We had a controlling, prying, noisy landlord who attempted regularly to bypass 
      the landlord-tenant laws in every way from unannounced, surprise visits, to using 
      the garage we were renting for his own purposes, to spying on us by looking in our 
      windows, to holding yard sales on our property without asking or notifying us.</p>

    <p>One day, my already frayed nerves encountered more than I could manage.</p>

    <p>My stoned roommate blared heavy metal music while dancing around the house in his 
      underwear screaming lyrics at the top of his lungs. </p>

    <p>Our landlord worked in “our” detached-garage while peering into our house windows 
      through a pair of binoculars. </p>

    <p>I attempted to deal with legal needs created by my “life-restructuring,” failing 
      miserably.  I felt frantic. I needed peace. I needed an escape.</p>

    <p>Despite the drizzling, cold late-March rain, I bundled up in rubber boots, a 
      rain-slicker, and gloves.  Pulling the hood of the slicker over my head, I bolted 
      out the front door like a house cat making a desperate play for freedom and went 
      for a walk. </p>

    <p>Walking usually has a therapeutic quality for me, but on the day in question I was 
      stirred up … not just because of my roommate and landlord, but from the personal 
      archaeological unearthing that deep inner work and personal growth create. </p>

    <p>I was enrolled in a personal growth program that would last several years. I was 
      trying to reconcile concepts of the Law of Attraction with my current reality. </p>

    <p>I was also reading Maximum Achievement: <em>Strategies and Skills that Will Unlock 
      Your Hidden Powers to Succeed</em>, by Brian Tracy. </p>

    <p>My heart was heavy, and my thoughts were disjointed. One minute my mind replayed 
      the antics of roommate and landlord, the next minute it practiced Brian’s technique, 
      then it swung between thinking about what I didn’t want and what I did want, then 
      back to my roommate, and so on. </p>

    <p>Somewhere in that swirling shamble, an inner voice said, “I would really like to 
      own my own home. Is that possible? What would have to happen to make it possible?”</p>

    <p>The thought had barely registered when I spotted an odd purple square on the sodden 
      ground, partially tucked into the winter grass. Enough of it was visible to display 
      the words, “Treasures from Tikashi.”</p>

    <p>I recognized the purple square as one of those inspirational/spiritual cards that 
       reader can use as a personal motivator, provoking insights for daily guidance. </p>

    <p>The card was soaked through, wrinkled, puckered, and darkly stained in one corner. 
      It had obviously been there for some time.</p>

    <p>The strangeness of it stopped me. There were no other cards or objects anywhere 
      around. Knowing how valuable these types of cards are to those of us who have them, 
      it seemed wrong to leave it lying there, abandoned. I took my right glove off and 
      carefully (to ensure I didn’t rip it) lifted the card and turned it over. The face 
      of the card read:</p>

    <hr />

    <h5 style="color: lime;">ABUNDANCE</h5>

    <p class="signature" style="text-align:center; color: lime;">Love, security, freedom, happiness, 
      support and finance are yours in abundance. The universe provides, it is up to you 
      to say ‘Yes!’</p>

    <p class="signature" style="text-align:center; color: lime;">All life flows with love, and you are 
      an energy being of love, you are not separate from what you desire. Let go of limited 
      expectations and acknowledge that you are worthy of all things.</p>

    <p class="signature" style="text-align:center; color: lime;">Participate in life’s joy and you shall 
      receive the rewards of your efforts.</p>

    <hr />

    <p>The rain changed from drizzle to downpour as I stood there blinking, awe struck, for 
      a full five minutes as the synchronicity of the situation sunk in. Then, with a squeal, 
      I jumped for joy.</p>

    <p>Rarely, before or since, have I received such a clear answer. With a combination of 
      irrational joy and expectation, my feet carried me back to my shared accommodations.</p>

    <p>Later that night, my mother called me. She worried about my living situation and 
      wondered what the current housing prices were in Calgary. How much would I need for 
      a down payment? She only had “this amount” that she could spare – would that be enough? 
      Could I manage the mortgage payments? We talked for several hours about my options.</p>

    <p>The first night I slept in my new condo was June 21st – the Summer Solstice, the 
      longest day of the year, exactly three months to the day after I found the Abundance 
      Card on the day of the Spring Equinox.</p>

    <p>I sent an email to the contact address on Brain Tracy’s website. I’m not sure why; 
      I just wanted to share with him the impact his work had made on my life. </p>

    <p>I wrote that when I started reading his book, like so many of the people he wrote 
      about, I thought to myself, “I’m not special. Can I really do this?” </p>

    <p>And, like the people in the stories he shared, I put aside my fears and used his 
      Law of Attraction technique. </p>

    <p>I assumed one of the staff who monitored the email would read it. I simply hoped 
      the person who read it would pass along my appreciation to Brian. </p>

    <p>The response to my note was simple. The email contained one line, “Congratulations 
      on discovering you are one of the special people.  &mdash;<em>Brian Tracy</em>”.</p>

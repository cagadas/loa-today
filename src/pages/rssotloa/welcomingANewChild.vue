    <h6 class="h6">By Dez Stephens</h6>

    <p>My current (and second) husband, Chuck, proposed to me on my 40th birthday. 
      It was a total surprise, and one of the mental flashes I had in that moment 
      was, “Because of my age, we need to get pregnant right away if we want a child!”</p>

    <p>My OB/GYN doctor agreed. She said, “Let’s get you on folic acid and prenatal 
      vitamins ASAP because you’re not getting any younger.” Then she described to 
      me all the reasons to be urgent in this matter, facts about the higher chances 
      of Down Syndrome, Spina Bifida, etc.</p>

    <p>When I was younger (in my 20s), I got pregnant quickly and easily. My first 
      husband and I had a daughter when I was 23, and I never had a thought like, 
      “Is it going to be hard to get pregnant?”</p>

    <p>But now, every month counted. Every month mattered because the statistics 
      showed the increased chances of pregnancy challenges due to “old eggs.” (Boy 
      did I get tired of hearing that term from my doctor, friends, and family 
      members – not the mention the Internet with all of its scary data.)</p>

    <p>My husband and I luckily got pregnant within two months when I was 40. We 
      went through the typical testing including an amniocentesis, a super long 
      scary needle in my belly to extract tissue to determine whether my child 
      had any birth defects. The whole pregnancy process was nerve-wracking because 
      there was always a sense of “tick tock, tick tock” based on my age.</p>

    <p>The initial test results came back “normal,” but our ultrasound at 22 weeks 
      was a very different matter. We were scheduled on a Monday for the appointment, 
      and I remember feeling a bit strange the weekend prior, like I had a stomach 
      ache that I’d never had before. When the technician put her equipment wand 
      on my stomach and started searching for the baby, her face went white.</p>

    <p>None of us heard a heartbeat. She said, “I’m going to get the doctor,” and 
      that was simply terrifying. My husband and I waited in frozen silence &ndash; even 
      holding our breath it seemed. Then the doctor came in to exam me and 
      unfortunately had to deliver bad news. Our baby had died. In a rare occurrence, 
      the umbilical cord got wrapped around his neck and suffocated him. Yes, our 
      genetic testing just six weeks prior showed it was a boy.</p>

    <p>We spent the next couple of days in the hospital with a procedure to remove 
      our baby boy from my very-pregnant looking body. When he was “born,” he had 
      all his fingers and toes and looked like a beautiful porcelain doll.</p>

    <p>We named him. We held him. We cremated him. Then we left the hospital without him.</p>

    <p>It was such a painfully intense week for us that led to an excruciating month 
      or so of, “What now?”… “Do we try again? Do we adopt instead? Do we let the 
      dream go?” At 41, these questions were not easy to answer.</p>

    <p>After two more years of trying, we realized that we were still grieving and not 
      emotionally ready at a subconscious level to get pregnant again. Then I had one 
      of those life-defining days.</p>

    <p>It was my 43rd birthday, and it was also Mother’s Day. My mother-in-law gifted 
      me with a white wrist flower corsage to represent the baby that we had lost. Then 
      she gifted me with another wrist corsage (for my other wrist) – with one blue and 
      one pink flower. (Yes like the kind that prom dates wear!)</p>

    <p>It was one of those very surreal moments we have in life. To my mother-in-law, 
      the pink and blue flowers represented the twins she wanted to help us “have” in 
      vitro. I was stunned.</p>

    <p>I walked into our pseudo-nursery and realized that we hadn’t officially welcomed 
      our baby because the nursery wasn’t finished yet. Then I noticed that everything 
      in the room was “dead.” There was a Purple Heart framed on the wall – my husband’s 
      Great Uncle’s from World War II. There was also his military outfit hanging in the 
      closet. In the corner was an ivory elephant tusk – a family heirloom.</p>

    <p>I immediately removed all the “dead stuff” and emptied out the entire room. Then 
      I placed a sweet little painting on the wall, painted by a friend specifically for 
      our nursery. We called it “Pinkie” because it was a cute little pink elephant.</p>

    <p>In writing down this story, I JUST NOW REALIZED that this “new” elephant item was, 
      in a way, the opposite of the “old” elephant tusk which, frankly, represented death 
      and animal abuse and negativity to me.</p>

    <p>It was May 11th, and I took yet another step toward something positive &ndash; 
      anything positive – to welcome a child into our lives. I emailed all my friends 
      and family to ask them for a favor. I knew that so many of them were feeling “bad” 
      for us about our miscarriage two years prior. I asked them something very simple 
      &ndash; to see me as a healthy happy pregnant mom-to-be. I basically asked them to 
      change their sadness into hope.</p>

    <p>Later that month, we got pregnant again! At the 12-week mark of our pregnancy, 
      we had a genetic test called a CVS (Chorionic Villus Sampling) so that we could 
      test for early signs of birth defects. It’s basically a DNA map of your child. 
      The nurse said to call the office “by Friday” if they didn’t call us with the 
      results.</p>

    <p>Friday came and we hadn’t heard anything, so at 4 PM I called the doctor. The 
      nurse said, “Oh, let me get the doctor,” so I started to panic. Minutes went by 
      and I tried to stay calm. FINALLY, she got back on the line and says, “I can’t 
      find the doctor so let me just tell you the results. It’s a 26Y.”</p>

    <p>I had no idea what that meant. I tentatively asked, “What is a 26Y?” and she 
      replied, “Oh, sorry. That means that your baby is a boy and he has all of his 
      necessary chromosomes. In other words, he’s perfect!”</p>

    <p>PERFECT. Our baby boy was PERFECT.</p>

    <p>And he is. His name is Merritt, and he’ll be nine years old next month.</p>

    <p>We are so grateful. We are always thinking, “Thank You, Thank You, Thank You!” 
      We are constantly in a state of gratitude about our son and our beautiful lives 
      together.</p>

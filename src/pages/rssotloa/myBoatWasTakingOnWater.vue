    <h6 class="h6">by Tom Wells</h6>

    <p>About seven years ago, the tidy, previously ever-upright sailboat of my life 
      was overturned in one fell swoop. Within a 12-month period, my lovely wife and 
      soulmate of 15 years divorced me; I lost my half-a-million-dollar home; I lost 
      my very lucrative business and income source which I had enjoyed for 25 years; 
      I lost half of my already inadequate life savings; and I got quite sick with a 
      debilitating sinus condition that had built slowly for years and now manifested 
      like the plague itself.</p>

    <p>To top it all off, I found myself growing and changing so much that I was no 
      longer able to believe in and rely upon the foundational support of the spiritual 
      teacher I had so happily depended on to carry me through the previous 40 years.</p>

    <p>I awoke each morning with my guts in a knot, a litany of unanswered questions 
      flooding my mind.</p>

    <p>Where was I going to live?</p>

    <p>How would I ever be able to own a home again?</p>

    <p>How would I create a new business and income? (I had been self-employed my whole 
      life and wasn’t likely to get a job. Nor did I want to get hired for a job.)</p>

    <p>How would I ever recover enough money or enough health to get me through my later 
      years (which I was already entering at age 61)?</p>

    <p>How would I fare without the support of the spiritual teacher and his philosophy 
      and meditation that I had relied on so long for my stability in life?</p>

    <p>At first, I embraced it all with my characteristic “I’ve got great sea-legs” 
      resilience, righted my little boat in the water, and began to act as if, “Of 
      course, I’ll nail all of this! Before long I’ll have a brilliant new career 
      firmly established, doing exactly what I love, a beautiful, super-compatible 
      new partner, and plenty of money to buy a new home and replenish my devastated 
      life savings! I know I can overcome this sinusitis and am sure I will unfold a 
      magical, transformative, and supportive spiritual experience that will guide me 
      to happiness and my wonderful new fulfilling destiny!”</p>

    <p>It took about a year and a half for me to realize that I was decidedly <em>NOT</em> 
      as resilient as I had assumed I was. Suddenly it seemed my life was adrift on a 
      sea of dilemmas as I sailed into a three-year period of the most choppy, “dark night 
      of the soul” waters that I had ever encountered. I realized that seasickness really 
      could affect me, and drowning was a distinct possibility. I had only a vague idea 
      of where these winds and waters might take me.</p>

    <p>I felt a calling to do life coaching, so I invested many hours and dollars in 
      learning two different forms of coaching ... but they just didn’t inspire me 
      enough. Even though I saw some clients, I wasn’t yet in the groove of doing my 
      life’s work, doing what I loved, although I knew I was close.</p>

    <p>I took every kind of workshop that came along that spoke to me, whether it was for 
      my heart and my spiritual development or for the development of my business. But 
      throughout it all, my worries about spending too much money with practically nothing 
      coming in haunted me day and night. I watched my life savings dwindle away week by 
      week, feeling a nearly ever-present dread of time and money running out. I remember 
      the day I found myself walking into the natural food store to buy my weekly groceries 
      thinking, “I’d better be really careful what I buy because I really can’t afford what 
      I want anymore!”</p>

    <p>Every morning, the seasick pain in my stomach reminded me once again of how anxious 
      I felt. My solution was nearly always the same. I knew I had to create a new business, 
      and I knew I had to do it NOW!!</p>

    <p><em>Work harder!</em> I told myself, <em>Be more diligent! Hoist the main-sail! Learn 
      more! Make more effort to apply what you’re learning! Get it together!</em></p>

    <p>As you might imagine, my solution was the problem. The rigid expectations I put on 
       only added to my stress.</p>

    <p>Patiently, characteristically, I set in for the long voyage to find land. I put my 
      back into the rowing and worked on my situation day and night from the little living 
      room of my condo, one lonely anxiety-ridden month after another. I felt like I was 
      literally in the doldrums, with false start after false start, feeling increasingly 
      disempowered, no wind in my sails, and not exactly enjoying my life. The harder I 
      rowed, the less progress I made.</p>

    <p>With so much of myself hyper-vigilantly focused in this fearful, survival-based mode, 
      I imagined I had little time for fun, family, and friends.</p>

    <p>So of course it was true ... I had little time for fun, family, and friends.</p>

    <p>I began to experience the breakdown of my friendships with many people I had known 
      for years and years. And of course, this felt crappy too. Loneliness and isolation 
      quickly set in.</p>

    <p>Woe was me ... no land in sight!</p>

    <p>I remember the day I sat in my recliner launching into yet another day of plodding 
      along, when it hit me so clearly that with all the self-criticism I felt toward myself, 
      my pessimistic thinking, my feelings of unworthiness and shame, poverty consciousness, 
      perfectionism, and over-thinking everything … the biggest obstacle to my forward 
      progress was no one else but ME!</p>

    <p>I had a close friend who spoke to me often about his thoughts of suicide, and I 
      found myself thinking, <em>Things can’t really be this hard, can they?? If it all 
      seems this impossible to have the life I want, and I am so prone to make it so 
      hard on myself, I can really understand how my friend has gotten to this place 
      of kind of wanting to check out.</em></p>

    <p>(I knew I wouldn’t really do it, but, by God, to actually think this way for the 
      first time in my life was shocking to me!)</p>

    <p>One summer’s night, I finally had enough. I determinedly jumped up and pulled out 
      a large piece of newsprint along with 10 colored markers and started feverishly writing 
      and drawing pictures all over the page of the things I absolutely knew I loved about 
      life … passionately … freely … joyfully …</p>

    <p>I drew people dancing, playing music, singing, rivers flowing through mountains, 
      deer, trees, the moon and sun, the things I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that I 
      believed in and was passionate about.</p>

    <p>In that moment I made a new commitment to myself that from that evening forward, 
      I would only settle for doing things, as my work in life, that authentically inspired 
      me and brought alive my passions and bliss!</p>

    <p>One day, a big, burly, sensitive friend named Ray invited me to a local fair of 
      psychics and healers of all sorts. I didn’t particularly want to go, but when the 
      day came, I showed up midway through the event, even though Ray bowed out.</p>

    <p>As I wandered through a room full of these gentle healers, for some reason, I was 
      drawn strongly to connect with one woman in the far corner. Her whole aura, attitude, 
      and mannerisms stood out in stark relief for me from the other practitioners in the 
      room.</p>

    <p>I handed her my 20 bucks, and she began to move around me as I stood there motionless. 
      Clicks, sighs, and sounds of various indescribable sorts emanated from her, and I 
      recognized the shamanic roots she drew upon as she circled me, touching me lightly 
      on my head, heart and neck. Strangely, happily, I felt she put me in some kind of 
      altered state. I felt light, floating, suspended as if in liquid, less in touch with 
      my logical, reasoning self.</p>

    <p>To my surprise, when she finished, she told me she had three messages for me:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>I should look into the work of Abraham and the Law of Attraction, as received 
        by Ester Hicks;</li>
      <li>I should take local classes in developing my psychic abilities; and</li>
      <li>I should get into a practice called Matrix Energetics.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Her recommendations felt like they came from some deeper knowing within myself, 
      that this was very different from following my mind’s lead in choosing yet another 
      book or seminar or teacher to look for hints to my life’s work. I didn't hesitate 
      at all in following through on all three suggestions.</p>

    <p>My work with the entities that call themselves “Abraham” most massively transformed 
      my life and continue to transform my life every day.</p>

    <p>Days later, I attended an event in my hometown of Boulder, Colorado with a roomful 
      of about 20 people on a Saturday morning. As we ate our pot-luck brunch, we watched 
      a live four-hour video feed from San Diego of Ester Hicks receiving these non-physical 
      entities as they answered the questions of various audience members about various 
      subjects.</p>

    <p>I couldn’t write fast enough to keep up with the constant stream of insights, 
      answers, and wisdom flowing through this woman! All that mattered to me was the 
      immense sense of <em>RELIEF</em> I received with all I heard. Land Ho! My wandering 
      vessel finally reached terra firma.</p>

    <p>Everything I had ever wondered about, struggled with, suffered with, worried over,
       had angst about, longed for wisdom and clarity about, needed to know what to do 
       about, needed to know how to do it, ALL OF IT, was answered by these funny and wise 
       entities speaking through the pleasant, normal voice of this distinguished, 
       well-spoken woman.</p>

    <p>Needless to say, I went back the next weekend for yet another four-hour screening. 
      EVERYTHING in my life began to transform.</p>

    <p>I dove into a six month long joyful process of compiling playlists of music gathered 
      from indigenous and ethnic peoples throughout the world, music I had largely obtained 
      from my shaman friend in New Mexico.</p>

    <p>I created six consecutive freestyle conscious dance events over a four-month period, 
      proving to myself the beauty and fulfillment of following my bliss.</p>

    <p>Could I make a living putting on dances?</p>

    <p>Would my idea of being a life coach satisfy the level of passion I had gotten in 
      touch with?</p>

    <p>I enrolled in a Law of Attraction life coaching academy to more formally augment my 
      learning with tried and true coaching principles.</p>

    <p>One warm summer’s day while hanging out at the vertical-walled Boulder Canyon, I 
      realized that I needed to start a practice of telling new, better-feeling stories 
      about my life.</p>

    <p>As the creek rushed by murmuring it’s reassuring water words over the tiny rapids, 
      I took out my journal and drew a line down the center of a page.</p>

    <p>On the left side of the page, I wrote my oh-so-familiar thoughts about my life’s 
      difficulties:  money woes, career dilemma, failing to find a life partner, 
      struggling to make new friends, wondering where to live, and so on.</p>

    <p>On the right side of the page I finally, finally, <strong><em>finally</em></strong>
      wrote what I wanted to see happen instead, with a knowing and a commitment to 
      accepting that it was truly possible to have my life start to show up as the new 
      better-feeling stories on the right side of the page!</p>

    <p>Inspired by a nice couple I know, I also soon vowed to stop talking about things 
      that I didn’t want to happen in my life.</p>

    <p>I’m back to sailing on the vast sea of my life, but no more in the fragile, 
      un-seaworthy vessel of a troubled, struggling existence. Now, it’s more like a 
      streamlined, double-hulled ocean-going catamaran, tacking steadily to the winds 
      of solutions and ease! I’m clearly the captain, and I’m clearly at the helm … and 
      that’s a good thing!</p>

    <p>It’s clear sailing from here on out. When the storms come, as they surely will do, 
      I’m ready for them. Drowning is no longer my focus. I’m in wide open waters, and I 
      can raise my sails and head for any destination I choose. The sun shines, the winds 
      blow strong and steady, and I love this infinite ocean!</p>

    <h6 class="h6">By Rhonda Burns</h6>

    <p>Even though the previous 18 months were chock full of bold new adventures, 
      radical life choices, out-of-my-comfort-zone experiences, beautiful new 
      friendships, and so much more, I recognized myself in a familiar space one 
      afternoon in 2012 as I reflected on what I really wanted my life to be like. 
      I was feeling pretty down and wondering if I’d made a mistake moving back to 
      the area I’d left just three years before, as I was feeling quite “stuck” and 
      stagnant in my life. In the three years I’d been away, I’d stretched myself, 
      healed, loved, forgiven, supported, celebrated, took big risks, moved states 
      three times, and grown more in that time span that I even knew was possible.</p>

    <p>I had this gnawing sense within me that maybe my dreams and my desires were 
      just too big. Maybe what I wanted was just too much ego talking, or for the 
      “wrong” reasons. It was like trying to push away one of those large inflatable 
      plastic clowns that are weighted at the bottom. Every time I would push the 
      thought or the dream away, it would just come bouncing right back up at me! 
      BOINGGGG!</p>

    <p>I finally decided to actually use some of the tools I knew to use. I pulled 
      out my journal and started to write down the things I wanted as I talked to 
      the Universe.</p>

    <p>“I don’t know how this is going to look, or how it’s going to show up, and it 
      doesn’t have to mean anything at all, but I REALLLLLLY want to show up in the 
      world in a much greater way. I’d like to be visible and make an enjoyable 
      contribution to the world. I know I have so much joy, laughter, humor and 
      kindness to offer the world; so Universe, please, what will it take for me to 
      be more visible and to be seen?”</p>

    <p>I wrote down some lines of gratitude and appreciation, then was able to close 
      the journal and get myself off the couch and out into my day with a smile back 
      on my face.</p>

    <p>Some of the things I jotted down included, “I love knowing that the Universe 
      is a friendly place – it gives me great comfort. I appreciate knowing that all 
      my needs are always met, even when I sometimes allow myself to stress when it’s 
      not required. I love having the freedom to have deeply, soul-fulfilling desires 
      that I know I can manifest. I’m grateful to know my own power and possibility 
      now.”</p>

    <p>A few months later, I received an email passed along by a friend from a 
      financial services company looking to interview people about their experiences 
      with financial services advisers. In exchange for 30 minutes of our time, there 
      was $300 cash for those they picked.</p>

    <p>I saw that email and thought to myself, “Hey, I have flexibility in my schedule, 
      and sure, I’d love $300 for 30 minutes of my time. What would it take? How much 
      fun can I have with this whole thing, no matter what happens or how it goes?”</p>

    <p>As I strolled through the produce aisle at the grocery store between the grapes 
      and the lettuce, I called the number in the email. The woman who answered and I 
      exchanged pleasantries, and she asked me if she could ask me a few preliminary 
      questions while we were on the phone. I agreed, and as I was picking out plums 
      and checking the ripeness of the avocados, I answered her questions with ease.</p>

    <p>Within just a few minutes of the Q&A, she asked me if I was available two days 
      from then to come into an area hotel and answer questions on camera for her client. 
      She said I’d be in a four-person panel, and they would do it on camera, so that 
      the client could see each individual’s responses to the subject of money and finances. 
      She also said that the client might need more information after that first round, 
      so I needed to be able to come in for a second session at a later date if they 
      determined more was necessary. I told her that wouldn’t be an issue and thought 
      to myself, “I think I just made $300 and maybe even $600 for an hour’s worth of 
      my time!” CHA-CHING!</p>

    <p>The day of the event, I woke up and started running through some fun questions 
      I loved to ask myself to keep me out of my head and away from, “figuring things 
      out”.</p>

    <p><em>I wonder how much fun I could have with this? I wonder how many new people 
      I can connect with and make smile? I wonder how much more of me I can show up as 
      today with no expectation of how that has to be. I wonder what magic is awaiting 
      me today. </em></p>

    <p>It’s like priming the pump with goodness and curiosity – a fantastic elixir.</p>

    <p>I arrived at the hotel on time, checked in with the registration staff, and was 
      asked to wait my turn. When I was called, they placed me in a panel with three men.
      Immediately, I thought to myself, <em>Oooh, I’m really going to be a ham with this. 
      I feel like being totally nonchalant and like I don’t have a care in the world.</em></p>

    <p>That was in stark contrast to the guys I was seated next to. They were quite stiff, 
      matter-of-fact, and seemed to keep trying to show how impressive they were with their 
      knowledge and their understanding of financial services. It really did feel a little 
      like a competition of “mine is bigger and better than yours.”</p>

    <p>I laughed on the inside, as I could feel just how ridiculous this felt to me. I 
      just wanted to have fun, so I did!</p>

    <p>I answered questions to the best of my ability, but I didn’t try to impress or prove 
      anything. I was the only one laughing during my portion of the Q&amp;A, and I was having 
      a grand time with the folks running the video camera and the computer.</p>

    <p><em>Hey,</em> I thought to myself, <em>I’m thrilled that I’m getting to be me, 
      to be happy, and I’m making $300 – in CASH – yeah, keep it coming, Universe!</em></p>

    <p>As we wrapped up our time together, I collected my envelope of cash and said goodbye 
      to the staff. They said that if I was going to be called back, it would be after the 
      holidays, so to just keep an eye on my email. I told them that would be great, and 
      off I went with even more bounce in my step!</p>

    <p>Just a couple of weeks later, upon return from a holiday trip with family, I got 
      another email from the coordinator I’d spoken with originally. She said that the 
      client did in fact want to meet with me again, only this time, I’d need to come 
      to downtown Dallas to a high rise office to meet with an actual financial adviser. 
      The plan was for the adviser to talk with me for 30 minutes and I’d walk away with 
      $300 cash again. I responded and told her I’d love to. We set the date and the time.</p>

    <p>Just a few days after our email exchange, the day arrived for me to head to the 
      downtown office to meet with the financial adviser. I met the registration staff 
      member down in the lobby that I’d seen at my last meeting, and she escorted me 
      up to the 38th floor of this beautiful office building that bustled with busy 
      corporate executives and office workers from the various companies in the building. 
      I walked into a chic lobby with a company nameplate across the wall, shook hands 
      with a well-groomed, neatly coiffed man typical of that of what you’d imagine when 
      you think of a financial planner: navy blue suit, crisp white shirt, beautiful 
      silk tie, and a short but stylish haircut.</p>

    <p>We shook hands and smiled at one another as he escorted me to a long, mahogany 
      meeting table in a well-lit conference room. We sat near one another, and after 
      the initial greetings and ice-breaking, he began to ask me general questions about 
      financial planning and my experience with various companies and nuances of the 
      experience.</p>

    <p>I was relaxed and at ease and was really being quite cheeky and irreverent having 
      so much fun with it, considering the topic was a bit “dry”. I had him laughing with 
      me at some points and after about 20 minutes of this exchange, he asked me if I 
      would be willing to invest my money with him.</p>

    <p>A bit shocked, I immediately responded with expletives that weren’t quite as mild 
      and polite as the “HECK NO!” here on the page. I told him that he seemed very 
      knowledgeable and professional, but I didn’t have enough information to make a 
      decision like that.</p>

    <p>He then proceeded to say, as he clicked a button on a remote aimed at a big screen 
      television at the end of the table hanging on the wall, waiting for the image to 
      illuminate the screen, “Well, that’s good, because I’m not actually a financial 
      planner. I’m actually, a DJ.”</p>

    <p>I then saw an image of him in long, blond dreadlocks, in a cut-off t-shirt, tattoos, 
      rings, and a nose piercing leaned over a turn-table record player, smiling. On the 
      right side of the split TV screen was his current form and fashion as he appeared 
      to me during our meeting.</p>

    <p>I immediately burst out, “No waaaay!”; laughing; dropping F-bomb after F-bomb, 
      asking him what in the world was going on and was this some type of joke? I was 
      so amused and so confused, but it was really the most hysterical experience, and 
      I loved being part of it.</p>

    <p>He then proceeded to wave to the wall sconces directly across the table from 
      where we were sitting and told me that they were actually filming a commercial 
      and they wanted real-world reactions to the content. I think you could have fueled 
      a city with the wattage coming out of my smile in that moment!</p>

    <p>Just about the time I was composing myself from laughing so hard, the side door 
      opened up and a producer walked in to meet me. She was thrilled with my reaction, 
      and as she escorted me through the door into unfinished office space behind the 
      conference room that was filled with production equipment and people, I received 
      a round of massive applause and high fives for my reaction. I was elated!</p>

    <p>The producer then filled me in on what was actually going on and that yes, I had 
      just been secretly filmed for a potential part in an upcoming national commercial 
      that their client was going to run for financial planning services. She said that 
      the client would be picking who they wanted to use in the commercial, but would I 
      be willing to fill out a SAG (Screen Actors Guild) card, as she felt sure that I 
      was a strong contender.</p>

    <p>I laughed and filled out the card in a heartbeat. In that moment, I looked up at 
      the ceiling, tossed my head back and just roared with laughter as I whispered to 
      the Universe:</p>

    <p>Oh my goodness, I could have NEVER seen this coming, nor have planned for it. 
      Thank you, Universe; this is the BEST surprise I’ve yet to receive. No matter 
      what happens from here, I know I showed up, and you delivered by matching what 
      I was choosing and being. Message received – got it! Now keep it coming!</p>

    <p>I collected my cash from the producer, and as I drifted out of that downtown 
      tower, I could have flown home on a cloud. I was so pumped with energy, enthusiasm 
      and sheer gratitude. I had so much fun relaying the story to friends and family, 
      and no matter whether I was cast in the commercial or not, I was so satisfied and 
      felt such joy and elation at that experience that I was completely content that 
      I got to experience it and be part of it. People could not believe the sheer 
      “luck” I had, or that I might be part of something longer term.</p>

    <p>Several months passed. I sat on my couch at home watching a favorite program one 
      night when I felt my cell phone vibrate on the cushion beside me.</p>

    <p>As I picked it up to see who texted, I laughed out loud as I read the following 
      from a local friend of mine, <em>Did I just see you in a commercial?!</em></p>

    <p>I chuckled and smiled as I texted back to him, <em>Well, it depends. What are you 
      watching, and what was the commercial about?</em></p>

    <p>To which he replied, <em>It was on a cooking show network, and it was for 
      financial planning.</em></p>

    <p>In that moment, I literally shrieked out loud to myself as I clapped my hands 
      together loudly, followed by a fist-pump or 10! I managed to calm down enough to 
      respond to my friend that yes, that was in fact me, and then I flipped to the 
      channel to wait and see if I could find the commercial.</p>

    <p>Sure enough, within minutes, there I was on the screen. It was surreal and fun 
      at the same time. I was still in shock that it manifested the way it did.</p>

    <p>I muttered under my breath, <em>Well, Universe, it never shows up the way I 
      think it will, does it? Thanks for rocking my world!</em></p>

    <p>Within a week, I began receiving checks from the talent company, and they 
      continued for over three years. How’s that for “ask and receive”? Simply by 
      choosing to ask, committing to taking inspired action, showing up, being me &ndash;
      no matter the circumstance or audience &ndash; I was richly rewarded beyond my 
      wildest dreams.</p>

    <p>I still get tickled when I think back to all the emails, calls and texts I 
      received from all over the country from friends and former colleagues, as well 
      as strangers I would meet who asked me, “Did I see you in a commercial?!”</p>

    <p>Even during one of the baseball World Series games, the commercial ran. How’s 
      that for “being seen” and being visible? Well, played, Universe … well played!</p>

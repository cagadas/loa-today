    <h5 class="h5 bottom0">Friends Delivered to Me By The Law of Attraction</h5>
    <h6 class="h6">by Wendy Dillard</h6>

    <p>Having a close friend to share my thoughts and deepest desires has always been 
      important to me. When I was married, my husband was my best friend and the one 
      with whom I shared deep and meaningful conversation. However, when he and I weren’t 
      getting along, I wished I had nurtured my before-marriage girlfriend relationships. 
      I found myself without a close female friend to discuss difficulties I was facing. 
      Since I have a big need to express myself verbally, I know that almost every time 
      I talk out my thinking to someone, I gain new insights. I love receiving new insights. 
      I practically live for them.</p>

    <p>After the divorce, I found myself in quite the conundrum. Even though my ex and I 
      parted on good terms, reaching out to him for good conversation was no longer an 
      option, as we had chosen to end our marriage so we could spread our wings and move 
      on in different directions.</p>

    <p>At this point in my life, I was using the Law of Attraction the best I knew how. 
      As I pondered my situation of not having any close friends, I was clear that I wanted 
      a girlfriend that lived close to me, so that I could call on a whim and ask her to 
      share a meal at a local restaurant. This girlfriend needed to love deep and meaningful 
      conversation like I did and be actively involved in her own personal development.</p>

    <p>I wondered if this was too much to ask. But, having studied Law of Attraction, I 
      recalled learning that <em>if I have the wherewithal to desire something, the Universe 
      has the wherewithal to deliver it to me.</em></p>

    <p>So, I set my intention on my new female friend. Then I quickly revised my request 
      have several close friends, not just one. The others didn’t have to live as close, 
      just close enough that we’d be within driving distance for in-person time together.</p>

    <p>In my area, we have hundreds of Meetups where you can connect with others locally 
      on practically any given subject matter and I regularly received email notices when 
      a new Meetup group had been launched.</p>

    <p>One day I saw the name of a new group that captured my attention. It was called the 
      “Wonder Tribe of North Texas.”</p>

    <p>I thought, “Hmmm, let’s read the description to learn more.”</p>

    <p>I could tell the description was written by a very positive, upbeat, highly energetic 
      woman. The thought of being with like-minded people like her really excited me, so I 
      joined.</p>

    <p>I got to the first Meetup a bit early where I was greeted by Rhonda, the leader of 
      the group. She was as energetic and welcoming as her group description. While engaging 
      her in conversation, I started to hope no one else would show up so I could spend more 
      time getting to know her. Also, I was wondering if maybe she would become my new 
      bestie. But then she mentioned where she lived, and I realized it was too far for 
      an impromptu dinner.</p>

    <p>Once other participants arrived, the Meetup began. The group conversation was definitely 
      to my liking, so I knew I wanted to do this again because it felt so invigorating to be 
      in the presence of like-minded people. Near the end of the gathering, Rhonda made a point 
      to let me know that the lady sitting across from me (Keisha) lived in the same town as 
      I did. So, Keisha and I agreed to car-pool to the next Meetup.</p>

    <p>The next Meetup was a month out, and as promised Keisha and I drove together. Our 
      conversation was quite stimulating both there and back. As the drive home was coming 
      to an end, I asked if she’d be interested in sharing a meal sometime. She said she’d 
      absolutely welcome that. I went home that night with a sense that I might have met 
      the new friend I was hoping to find that lived near me!</p>

    <p>Even though I was eager to schedule a dinner, I wanted to go slow because I’d been 
      burned before – thinking I’d made a new friend only to find subsequent conversations 
      were boring. But, driving together to the next <em>Meetup</em> was around the corner, so 
      I knew we’d have another opportunity to see if our conversation was just as satisfying. 
      <em>And it was!</em></p>

    <p>We spent hours in deep conversation during our first dining excursion, not leaving 
      until the restaurant was closing. And we knew we’d not even begun to scratch the 
      surface of the things we could talk about.</p>

    <p>We began to meet for dinner more often until it became a weekly event that we both 
      looked forward to with great anticipation. During the week, I’d keep track of the 
      things I wanted to talk about with her, so that when Friday night came, I was prepared 
      with all sorts of fun ideas to discuss. And little did I know, she was doing the same 
      thing. Our conversations went all over the place from personal development to 
      technology to childhood stories to our thoughts on global consciousness. We could 
      literally talk about anything with one another.</p>

    <p>As a life coach, having a friend where we could engage in coaching conversations was 
      an aspect I really desired in a friendship. During one of our weekly dinners, I asked 
      Keisha for some coaching to which she was agreeable. I found her insights refreshing, 
      and I definitely appreciated the different point-of-view she came from.</p>

    <p>One hiccup we faced as friends was that even though we both spoke English, how we 
      expressed our experiences was very different. I come from a left brain, logical and 
      linear perspective. Whereas, Keisha comes from a very right brain, etheric perspective. 
      She sees the world through Energy (the unseen level of our existence). I’d never met 
      anyone like her before that interpreted the world through Energy and the non-physical. 
      We often had to interrupt our flow of conversation to define terms to try to get to 
      the heart of what was being communicated which left me feeling very frustrated.</p>

    <p>I recalled that when I was requesting a like-minded friend, I had specifically said 
      to the Universe that this person didn’t have to know the same personal development 
      systems that I knew, so long as she was passionate about her own personal evolution. 
      If she was schooled in different techniques, that could be even better because I could 
      learn new ways to work on issues that could benefit both myself and my clients. (Be 
      careful what you wish for!) Keisha was definitely as passionate about personal growth 
      as I was, but her terminology was so different from mine.</p>

    <p>But even with our communication challenges, our conversations were fun, exciting, 
      and incredibly inspiring. One night, as we were saying our good-byes, Keisha said, 
      “I can’t wait to see how much our lives will have changed by next week.”</p>

    <p>And she was right, our lives really were making dramatic changes from week-to-week. 
      Whatever topics we discussed fueled our desires to easily show up by the following 
      Friday night (or at the very least, we’d see evidence of the desire making its way 
      into reality).</p>

    <p>Keisha and I were tenacious and eventually came to a place of more easily understanding 
      each other. We’re continually amazed at the amount of personal growth we’ve each 
      experienced in the time we’ve been friends.</p>

    <p>One of the Meetups Rhonda arranged was to attend an Abraham-Hicks workshop. Since 
      I’m a huge Abraham-Hicks fan, I immediately signed up for this road trip that I knew 
      would give us a four-hour drive to talk. During the drive, I shared a painful 
      childhood story, to which Rhonda coached me into new empowering beliefs. And since 
      then, Rhonda and I have shared girlfriend / coaching conversations on numerous 
      occasions.</p>

    <p> Rhonda’s Meetup came to an end after only a handful of gatherings. But Rhonda 
      believes (and so do I) that the primary purpose for creating this Meetup was because 
      it was the Universe’s way to connect us and for her to introduce me to Keisha.</p>

    <p>A short time later, at an Abraham-Hicks land-cruise in Cancun, I met Clarissa. While 
      sharing an elevator ride, we learned that we both lived in the same city, so we 
      exchanged business cards promising to be in contact when we arrived home. Humorously, 
      a year later when planning to go to a local Abraham-Hicks workshop, I texted her to 
      see if she planned to attend and she responded that she would be there.</p>

    <p>Clarissa and I hugged at the workshop, laughing at how we’d not been in touch since 
      Cancun. I found out that Clarissa was a practitioner of services I could use. So, we 
      purposely scheduled my appointments at the end of her work day, so we could grab 
      dinner afterwards and enjoy some juicy Law of Attraction conversation. As our 
      friendship was blossoming, I’d had the internal nudge to introduce Clarissa and 
      Keisha.</p>

    <p>So, my next impulse was to schedule a lunch for the four of us (me, Rhonda, Keisha 
      and Clarissa). Our synergy was unlike anything I’ve ever experienced. The four of us 
      now meet periodically where we’re never at a loss for conversation or laughs! We are 
      so on the same vibrational wavelength. It’s truly inspirational! (And as I suspected 
      Keisha and Clarissa struck up a wonderful friendship for themselves.)</p>

    <p>I now have individual friendships with Keisha, Rhonda and Clarissa that are unique, 
      each satisfying a different aspect of me. But, having all four of us like-minded 
      women hanging out together is <em>game-changing!</em> We now call ourselves the 
      “Fab Four,” which perfectly suits us. We are four fabulous women choosing to live 
      our lives at the highest level. When we’re together, we support one another, share 
      our latest epiphanies, and do a lot of laughing!</p>

    <p>Even though I’ve been applying the principles of Law of Attraction for a number of 
      years, it never ceases to amaze me when experiencing the full manifestation of 
      something for which I’ve asked. I’m always surprised and delighted at how it shows 
      up because it’s always so much better than I could have planned.</p>

    <h6 class="h6">by Esther Bailey-Bass</h6>

    <p>It was a beautiful sunny day in May, with a breeze and a slight chill in the air. 
      I remember it was Monday, May 1, 2017, typical as any other Monday before.</p>

    <p>I readied myself for work, and as I proceeded to leave the house, I turned down 
      the thermostat, set the house alarm, then closed and locked the door behind me. I 
      noticed that I was leaving on time ... in fact, a little early.</p>

    <p>I got into the car, and using the hand remote I opened the garage door and drove 
      the car outside onto the driveway. Again using the hand remote, I closed the garage 
      door. Just as I was pulling away, I noticed the garage door was still open.</p>

    <p>“Huh, that was odd,” I said.</p>

    <p>So, I tried it again, and this time I watched the door close completely, then 
      open again.</p>
    <p>Not wanting to leave home with the garage door open and easy access to tools, 
      lawn mower, yard equipment, bikes and more, I got out of the car to investigate.</p>

    <p>First, I went to the wall unit to close the door from there. The same thing happened. 
      The garage door went up and down and then up again.</p>

    <p><em>Check the sensors,</em> I thought.</p>

    <p>So I did, and they seemed to be aligned. How could I tell? Again, I used the hand 
      remote, the same thing. The wall unit, the same thing – the garage door went up and 
      down and then up again.</p>

    <p>“What!?” I screamed.</p>

    <p><em>I don’t have time for this.</em></p>

    <p>Then I remembered that James, my husband, had adjusted the motor. So I decided 
      I would climb up onto a bench and check the motor. Maybe I could manipulate 
      something there.</p>

    <p>I did, and then again with the hand remote, I pressed the button to open and 
      close the garage door.</p>

    <p>It worked, the garage door was down completely. Now on the inside, I was faced 
      with a dilemma. Do I attempt to open the garage door using the hand remote or 
      wall unit, or would the problem persist?</p>

    <p>I remembered James once told me I could pull the red string to detach the garage 
      door from the motor and then lift the door open manually.</p>

    <p><em>That’s it! That’s what I’ll do.</em></p>

    <p>Something inside me was a little twitchy at this idea but I went for it anyway.</p>

    <p>I pulled the red string and heard a sound of something becoming unhinged. Now 
      I’ll be able to manually open and close the garage door then go onto work.</p>

    <p>Not so fast.</p>

    <p>I went to lift the garage door. I pulled and tugged as hard as could, but it was 
      impossible to move even a little bit.</p>

    <p><em>Wait, I have muscles, I’m not weak. I can do this!</em></p>

    <p>So I tried again, and still not even the slightest budge would the door make.</p>

    <p>I was locked in.</p>

    <p>It was in that moment I realized I was trapped in the garage with no way out. 
      The onset of panic came quickly. Standing in the middle of the garage, nearly in 
      tears, I twirled around like Cinderella.</p>

    <p><em>What just happened? What did I do?</em></p>

    <p>In a panic stricken voice, I said to myself, “Calm down, take a breath, think.” 
      I was going to meditatively coach my way out.</p>

    <p>Yeah, right! That was B.S.</p>

    <p>What could I do? Who could help me? My car, with the keys in the ignition, 
      cell phone and purse on the seat, was on the other side of the garage door.</p>

    <p><em>WTF!</em></p>

    <p>What to do? Well, I did what anyone would do in a similar situation. 
      I screamed and cried for help.</p>

    <p>There was just a sliver of space between the garage door and wall, 
      and through it I screamed for help, calling out, “Neighbor, neighbor help!”</p>

    <p>It seemed utterly useless.</p>

    <p>Looking around the garage for an answer, a way out, I heard sirens in the 
      distance, and that triggered a memory.</p>

    <p>“There’s a phone in here,” I said.</p>

    <p>Immediately, I rushed to search for the cordless phone. I had placed it 
      in the garage for this exact reason.</p>

    <p>I found it, but James had unplugged it. When I plugged it into the outlet it read, 
      “Warning check battery … warning check battery.”</p>

    <p>Surely, it won’t take long to get a charge, and I could call 911 for help.</p>

    <p>While the phone was charging, I got down on my hands and knees and began 
      screaming through the exhaust vent to the neighbor next door.</p>

    <p>“Help, neighbor, help!”</p>

    <p>No one. Nothing. Crickets.</p>

    <p>I went between the cordless phone, the exhaust vent, and garage door screaming 
      for help.</p>

    <p>Then I thought, <em>How can I trip the lock on the interior house door. I’ve seen 
      this done before.</em></p>

    <p>Sure, but it doesn’t work on a deadbolt lock, and I knew that before I even tried, 
      but thought I’d go for it anyway.</p>

    <p>The cordless phone panel kept blinking, “Warning, check battery … warning, check 
      battery.”</p>
    
    <p>I felt a sense of despair that I would be locked in the garage until someone came, 
      perhaps the mailman or James coming home from work.</p>

    <p>Eureka! I’ll dismantle the outside lock of the garage door and use a pole with a 
      rag attached, stick it through the hole to draw attention to passersby.</p>

    <p>So I fashioned a kind of surrender flag and stuck it through the lock hole, waving 
      frantically to no one. Cars would pass by with windows rolled up against the chilly day.</p>

    <p>The UPS truck went speeding by. The next-door neighbor pulled into their driveway but 
      was deaf to my screams.</p>

    <p><em>No phone.</em></p>

    <p><em>No response.</em></p>

    <p><em>No keys.</em></p>

    <p><em>No way out.</em></p>

    <p>I felt a sense of exhaustion take over me, and then I heard: <em>RESIGN</em>.</p>

    <p><em>From what, my job?</em> My body felt exhausted and I surrendered. I had been 
    planning to leave my employment over the past 5 years.</p>

    <p>Pausing to listen, the word settled in me, and I obliged myself to sit down. 
      I pulled up a bench and sat in front of the garage door, looking back and forth 
      asking myself, <em>How does it work?</em> I don’t know how a garage door works. 
      <em>How does it work?</em></p>

    <p>It was like asking a genie in a bottle for a wish.</p>

    <p>Before I could say or hear the word “hands” I sensed them, and there they were, 
      right in front of me. Then I heard, “You can do it,” in a warm, confident, 
      encouraging tone.</p>

    <p>It was a familiar voice. Somehow I knew this voice. It was an aspect of myself 
      from long before college, marriage, and the mundane.</p>

    <p>She was my encourager, a voice of wisdom, clarity, and certainty. I knew her 
      because we had played together before, and I was inclined to follow her lead. 
      So, I reverse engineered my steps.</p>

    <p><em>Hands.</em></p>

    <p><em>What did I do?</em></p>

    <p><em>You did <u>this</u>.</em></p>

    <p><em>When I did that, what happened?</em></p>

    <p><em><u>This</u> happened.</em></p>

    <p>So, I climbed up onto the bench looking for what had detached. Using my hands, 
      I latched two metal arms together. Something in me said, “That’s it, now try.” 
      With the hand remote still in my hand, I stood suspended and pushed the button. 
      Just like magic, the garage door opened.</p>

    <p>Now free, I was dumbfounded. I remember looking at the clear blue sky, uncertain 
      what to do next. I was baffled. So I got in the car and sat for a while before 
      calling work to explain why I would be late. Then I called my mother to tell her 
      what had just happened. After being trapped in the garage for nearly two hours, 
      I ended up being my own rescue.</p>

    <p>Seven months later, I did in fact resign from my employer after nearly 18 years 
      of service. Life on the other side is already proving sweeter.</p>

    <h6 class="h6">by Cathy Brown</h6>

    <p>I learned about negative manifesting the hard way.</p>

    <p>A few years back I was driving home from a visit with my Mom, who was 96 at the time 
      and living in an assisted living facility after my Dad transitioned (passed away) a 
      year earlier at age 94.  (I’ve got good genes ... thank you Universe).  The visit didn’t 
      go too well.  She was not in the greatest mood.  At 96, Mom’s demeanor was often 
      unpredictable.</p>

    <p>I was not in the greatest mood either as I drove home.  I felt a little sorry for myself, 
      focusing on why can’t Mom be happy to see me, since I was so busy yet I had taken time to 
      spend with her when I could be doing so many other (in my mind) more productive activities. 
      I was far from accepting of her feelings, aches and pains.  I now realize it would have 
      taken so little to be more understanding.</p>

    <p>What energy or thoughts do you think I was sending out?</p>

    <p>About halfway home, a large SUV in the middle lane suddenly decided to make a right 
      turn.  Too bad I was in the right lane!  I slammed on my brakes just as I saw her cut 
      in front of me, but I couldn’t stop quickly enough to avoid her smashing into by left 
      side.  At least by hitting my brakes, I avoided a much worse collision.</p>

    <p>I went ballistic.</p>

    <p>We pulled over and the negative energy swirled as she spoke only in broken English. 
      She couldn’t find her license and was driving her brother’s car.  I could feel the 
      anger flaring up inside of me. This was my first accident in over 20 years.</p>

    <p> I didn’t think to call the police, just my insurance company.  My agent tried 
      unsuccessfully to understand the other driver.  Getting nowhere, my agent suggested 
      I just stop the confrontation and take my car in for an estimate.  She booked an 
      immediate appointment.</p>

    <p>I was still furious as I drove to the dealer for a damage estimate.</p>

    <p>Why did this happen to me?</p>

    <p> I didn’t take responsibility for creating the events in my life at all.  Cooling 
      my heels in the dealer’s waiting room helped a little, but you could still cut through 
      my negativity with a knife.</p>

    <p>The mechanic kept coming in to say, “Relax, it will be fine”, but I wasn’t buying it.  
      The estimate came to about $1200, of which $500 was my deductible.  This just increased 
      my anger and negativity.  I didn’t stop to think that if I was not at fault, I would 
      be totally covered, nothing out of pocket.</p>

    <p>I begrudgingly thanked the mechanic, got back into my car and backed out of the service 
      bay – right into a brand-new car.  That’s right, I ran into another car – my second 
      accident that day!  This time there was no question who was to blame: me.</p>

    <p>Sometimes if I don’t get it the first time, the Universe has to whomp me up the side 
      of my head.</p>

    <p>Now whenever I start to go negative, I take a step back, take a few deep breaths, and 
      focus on something positive.  It takes a mere 17 seconds to start to reverse a vibration 
      and 68 seconds to start to manifest that new vibration.  Much better than having two 
      accidents.  Lesson learned!</p>

    <p>In 2014, I enrolled in Christy Whitman’s Quantum Success Coaching Academy’s (QSCA) 
      program totally focused on becoming a great Law of Attraction life coach.  I was about 
      halfway through the program when I heard about the annual QSCA business meeting in 
      California.</p>

    <p>Invitations were sent to all graduates and students to gather for the weekend to 
      network and learn from noted metaphysical speakers while meeting the instructors and 
      Christy herself. This sounded like something right up my alley.  I hadn’t had a 
      proper vacation in a few years, and the opportunity to meet Christy was just too 
      much to resist.  I signed up on the spot.</p>

    <p>On the flight from Ohio to California, I read The Prosperous Coach, by Steve Chandler 
      and Rich Litvin.  The authors said you can only take a client as far as you are willing 
      to go yourself.  How can you expect a client to buy into the concept of coaching if 
      you don’t buy into it enough to have a coach yourself and continue to grow in your 
      business and personal life? That was an “a ha” moment for me.</p>

    <p>At 30,000 feet, I set my intention.  <em>I am going to get a coach this weekend.</em>  
    I had no idea who, or how, but I would get my coach this weekend.  I closed my eyes 
    and asked the Universe to assist in bringing my coach to me.  Then I let to go of my 
    intention.  Every time I thought about the upcoming meeting, I totally focused on 
    finding my new coach.</p>

  <p>The flight was great, the hotel in San Diego was fabulous, and the meeting was really 
    inspiring.  I met so many spiritually minded people and developed many lasting 
    friendships.  I sat in the front row for all the sessions, as my 5’2’ stature made it 
    difficult to see over people sitting in front of me.</p>

  <p>I had almost forgotten about my intention of finding my coach with all the activities 
    and excitement of the speakers and seeing Christy Whitman live.</p>

  <p>Then on Saturday, just before lunch, it happened.  Christy began to explain a new 
    mentoring program she was starting.  It was not for everybody, only a select group 
    of five to six coaches who wanted to excel in their business.</p>

  <p>I nearly fell off my chair.  THIS IS IT!   Christy is going to be my coach.  
    I just have to do this.</p>

  <p>It never crossed my mind that I was only six months into the training and there were 
    over 100 people in the audience, most more qualified than me.  I just knew Christy was 
    going to be my coach. I can’t explain it, I just felt it in my bones.</p>

  <p>I came back to reality to hear Christy say she would give all the details after lunch.</p>

  <p>As she finished and released us all for our lunch break, I jumped up and ran to the 
    stage where Christy was collecting her notes.  On pure adrenaline, I stammered quite 
    loudly, “Christy … I’m a … I’m Cathy Brown, and I want to do this … I really want 
    this.”  I must have sounded like a crazy person, a bit off balance.   I felt the 
    Universe was setting this up for me.</p>

  <p>Christy turned around, smiled and sort of giggled I think, and said “OK Cathy, I’ll 
    get the application to you after lunch.”  I was on Cloud Nine.  I wanted a coach, but 
    I never thought it would be Christy Whitman.  Christy was the New York Times bestselling 
    author, CEO and founder of the QSCA and top spiritual leader.  WOW!</p>

  <p>Once again, I didn’t give any energy to the fact that I was probably one of many applying 
    for the mentorship and one of the least qualified.</p>

  <p>That afternoon, along with many others, I filled out the application and just let it go.  
    I allowed the Universe to take control, trusting that the result would be in my best 
    interest.</p>

  <p>Little did I know, Christy was intrigued with me.  She was genuinely impressed that I 
    was willing to commit and trust the Universe to bring this to me without having any of 
    the details, investment or anything.  I appeared to have total trust in her and in the 
    Universe.</p>

  <p>Unknown to me at the time, Christy started to “check me out” by talking to my instructor 
    and others who knew me from the program.  The Universe was setting things in motion.</p>

  <p>During the final session on Sunday, Christy thanked all of us who applied saying she 
    would email those selected early next week.</p>

  <p>My homeward bound flight was scheduled on Monday morning.  While waiting in the lobby 
    for the airport taxi, Christy and her husband walked by the front desk, and I heard 
    somebody call my name.  I turned around to see Christy Whitman walking over to me 
    smiling.  She gave me a big hug while whispering “Congratulations, you are in the 
    Mentor program.  I’m going to be your coach.”</p>

  <p>This is one of the few times in my life that I was speechless.  When I finally regained 
    my composure, all I could say was, “It works, this stuff really works”, then of course, 
    “Thank you so much”.</p>

  <p>Christy looked a bit puzzled and replied, “Great, yes it does work.”</p>

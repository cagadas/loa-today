    <h5 class="h5 bottom0">Out Of The Darkness</h5>
    <h6 class="h6">By Michael Craig</h6>

    <p>I only discovered the real Law of Attraction at a time when my life was at its 
      lowest point, a time when I realized like Janis Joplin that, “Freedom’s just another 
      word for nothing left to lose…”   Money was really scarce. I got divorced (again), 
      was fed up with my career, and felt I had nothing of value to share with the world.</p>

    <p>Oh, and I also did affirmations.  Religiously.  I woke up, looked at myself in 
      the mirror and repeated the “I love you, you are good-looking, rich and loved” 
      mantras.</p>

    <p>For years.</p>

    <p>Nothing but grief followed me.  As much as I tried to shut out this negative 
      force, my dark side kept pounding into me like a pile driver into the sand.</p>

    <p>I felt hurt, poor, unloved, and generally miserable in spite of my efforts 
      to talk myself out of this condition.</p>

    <p>The lowest point came after my first divorce when my girlfriend killed herself.</p>

    <p>I spent the next year feeling numb – not caring who I slept with, earning 
      money any way I could, and generally becoming a genuine S.O.B.</p>

    <p>It was then that the migraine headaches started.</p>

    <p>Another marriage didn’t help.  I ended up divorcing her as well after 
      cheating on her several times and feeling so worthless that I contemplated 
      my own suicide.</p>

    <p>The headaches only got worse.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h6 class="h6">The Silent Prayer</h6>

    <p>It was at this point that I consider my darkest night of the soul that 
      I fell to my knees and admitted defeat.  I knew no way out and finally 
      asked God to help.</p>

    <p>I didn’t expect anything, but after my acknowledged defeat, life suddenly 
      switched on.  I found I didn’t need affirmations ... just the ability to 
      let go of the chaos!</p>

    <p>Soon I met the woman of my dreams.  Brigitte brought me back from the 
      brink.  She stayed with me while I released all the pent-up anger.  She 
      worked with me to discover and establish a powerful method of healing and 
      self-discovery that I’ve used successfully on myself and others for many 
      years.</p>

    <p>It even cured my headaches.</p>

    <p>Now, over 25 years later, Brigitte and I are still happily married and 
      living in our paid-for home.  We also have some vacation property, paid 
      off our debts, and developed a way to earn a comfortable income from home.  
      We are also pretty active and healthy.</p>

    <p>I don’t say this to brag.  Far from it, I am most grateful for the gifts 
      I’ve received in my life ... especially those painful episodes that awakened 
      me to the limitations of my thoughts and affirmations.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h6 class="h6">You can do this yourself</h6>

    <p>Look around you.  What do you see?  Who are you with?  Well guess what:  
      these are things (and people) you have already attracted!</p>

    <p>I found this out when I became honest enough with myself to know I didn’t 
      know squat!  My “saying” some affirmation also carried with it the opposite 
      of the affirmation ... each thought contained within itself its own mirror.</p>

    <p>If I affirmed, “I easily attract $5000 or more each month in personal 
      income,” I may have felt good about “doing something” to attract more wealth, 
      but to no avail. I soon discovered that the hidden decisions my subconscious 
      mind drove home were just the opposite, i.e., “This is total B.S.; I always 
      lose more money than I make!”</p>

    <p>Using a technique based on affirmations and testing, I was able to discover 
      in myself and others the pathway to communication with the hidden being in all 
      of us.  The ancient Hawaiians had a name for it; they called it the Ku or 
      Unihipili (I started using Ku because “The One Who Makes Things Happen” was 
      too damn long).</p>

    <p>Years of testing proved my method worked.  The people I worked with reported 
      that they were more in touch with the hidden decisions that ran their lives, 
      and were able to start attracting more good things into their lives; soul mates, 
      more money, diseases and infirmities disappearing, and an overall sense of 
      happiness with themselves and with life.</p>

    <p>I found out I didn’t have to live a life full of struggle.  My struggles, 
      in fact, were simply a reaction to the hidden decisions that constantly 
      goaded me to create more drama.</p>

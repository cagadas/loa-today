    <h5 class="h5 bottom0">Beginning Again</h5>
    <h6 class="h6">by Sherry Trentini</h6>

    <p>Grief sucks. I know this to be true. I became a widow at age 40. My daughters, ages 8 and 10, 
      lost their daddy.  Then five months later my own father died.</p>

    <p>It was an exceptional year for us, to say the least.</p>

    <p>Grief has the unique ability to make everything feel like it’s going too fast, while 
      simultaneously feeling as if you are standing still.  It is plump with conflicting 
      emotions, disconnected and scattered feelings, and there can be more questions than 
      answers.</p>

    <p>And those questions are endless when the cause of death is suicide. I didn’t have 
      answers to those questions for my daughters or anyone else.</p>

    <p>Why did this happen?  Why did he do this? How can this be happening?  To us or to 
      anyone?</p>

    <p>In the months that followed, I did my best to field my girls’ questions.  They were 
      valid. They wanted answers. In their way and at their age they needed something, 
      anything, to try to make sense of it all.</p>

    <p>I believe that grief is a part of life, but it didn’t have to be our life.</p>

    <p>I made the decision to move overseas 14 months after my husband passed away.  I put 
      our acreage on the market, boxed up the contents, let go of a large amount of stuff 
      by either selling it or gifting it, and we set off for our international adventure.</p>

    <p>The home we left was over 3,400 square feet of living area. In contrast we moved 
      into a quaint furnished cottage of about 700 square feet.</p>

    <p>Talk about downsizing!</p>

    <p>We lived simply, and I measure "simply" not only in actual size but in features.  
      The comfort I found in making that change was that we lived within what we needed. 
      There was zero unused space.</p>

    <p>I hosted a Canadian-style Thanksgiving for twelve people, feeding them all the 
      traditional fare, and did so without having things like...</p>

    <ul>
      <li class="li">a double oven</li>
      <li class="li">a double sink</li>
      <li class="li">a dishwasher</li>
      <li class="li">a formal dining room table</li>
      <li class="li">an 8’ x 4’ counter for the buffet</li>
      <li class="li">various kitchen gadgets and accouterments, etc…</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Everyone ate, drank and enjoyed the celebration.</p>

    <p>Would I have attempted to make such a drastic change in houses if we'd stayed 
      in Canada?  I doubt it.</p>

    <p>Did I miss certain creature comforts? No question.</p>

    <p>Am I blessed that my girls adjusted to sharing a bedroom smaller than either 
      of their previous rooms was?  Absolutely.</p>

    <p>Before you would have to look for where a person was in the house.</p>

    <p>Now you were acutely aware of everyone's breathing patterns.</p>

    <p>ot to mention one bathroom for three girls …</p>

    <p>In order to move forward, I believe it is necessary to lighten your load, 
      literally and figuratively. I asked myself If I didn’t have the physical space 
      to keep these items, what would I do with them?  Would I pay to store them elsewhere?  
      How much would I invest to do so?</p>

    <p>I didn't question the contents that my amazing team of friends came and lovingly 
      packed up with me.  Not only did I have a tight time constraint to get this done 
      and on the airplane, everything that I did not let go of retained a high level of 
      value, especially emotional value.</p>

    <p>I attracted the most perfect people to help me move forward with these tasks, and 
      I also attracted the most perfect people to be caregivers of our property in our 
      absence.  Both our bags and my heart were tremendously lighter because of that.</p>

    <p>Selling property can be a true test of patience. When that property doesn’t sell, 
      it can be a pop quiz on one's self worth. The house I was selling burst with emotions.  
      It wasn't just a property. It was:</p>

    <ul>
      <li class="li">the house my husband and I built,</li>
      <li class="li">on the land that he and I loved, </li>
      <li class="li">in the community that we helped to create, </li>
      <li class="li">in association with the business he had dreamed of starting and owning for years,</li>
      <li class="li">for friends, family, Thanksgivings, Christmases, birthdays, and celebrations of all things,</li>
      <li class="li">in our family home that our girls were to grow up in, move out of, and come back to.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I am keenly aware of and attuned to listening to my "gut" as my intuitive guide.  
      Three main things came up for me:</p>

    <ol>
      <li class="li">Whenever I thought of the house, I felt a clenching in my chest … not good.</li>
      <li class="li">I felt that as much as I wanted to sell it I was clutching it to my chest ... 
        not conducive to manifesting a buyer.</li>
      <li class="li">Whenever the girls and I talked about the house, it sounded like we were talking 
        about their dad, not the building … tricky.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>So I asked myself two questions:</p>

    <ol>
      <li class="li">If we weren't in Europe right now would I be selling the house?<br />
        <blockquote>Answer: Yes</blockquote>
      </li>
      <li class="li">If we were to repatriate to Canada tomorrow, next month, or next year, would we move back into the house?<br />
        <blockquote>Answer: No</blockquote>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>So I created some affirmations, “I am so grateful for receiving the most perfect offer 
      on my house now.  I willingly let it go to the new owners with love.”</p>

    <p>Every time I thought of the house I immediately started to affirm letting it go with 
      love.</p>

    <p>Every time we spoke of a family memory, I would thank the house and affirm letting 
      it go with love.</p>

    <p>Every opportunity I could change the language in association with the house, I did.  
      And it began to feel better and easier.</p>

    <p>The next thing I did was write a letter and asked my girls to do the same.  
      The letter was dual purpose:   first it was to express our gratitude to and for 
      the house and land; and secondly it was a welcome letter to the “Most Perfect 
      New Owners.”</p>

    <p>I started by expressing gratitude to the house for keeping us safe, warm in winter, 
      cool in summer, for being the most perfect place to live, for being such a gracious 
      host to our celebrations with family and friends and for daily living.</p>

    <p>I thanked it for being “the most perfect place” for the girls to have grown up.  
      I thanked it for all the attributes that sprung to mind.</p>

    <p>I then thanked my husband for choosing the location, for creating such an amazing 
      yard, for tending to the land and respecting it.  For all the things he did to make 
      the house our home.</p>

    <p>I thanked everyone who ever came through my door and for adding such positive energy 
      to our space.</p>

    <p>Next, I welcomed the new family.  I told them how they had made the “Most Perfect” 
      choice to live there.  I excitedly told them about all the wonderful reasons they 
      will love living there.  How the yard and valley craved for kids to run, play and 
      explore.  How breathtaking the valley was in every season and to watch for the ample 
      wildlife.  I shared how strong and secure the house was and that it would love being 
      freshened up to reflect their style.  And I affirmed all of their reasons for choosing 
      to make this their home.</p>

    <p>After completing the letters, we read them out loud, which led us to share stories 
      and memories.  When we spoke about those things, it felt good. It didn't feel like 
      loss.  It helped us shift from "clutching onto it" to "releasing it peacefully".</p>

    <p>To finish what now had become ceremonial, we burned our letters and released them … 
      with love.</p>

    <p>I then asked my agent for a blank copy of the offer to purchase, which I then filled 
      in with every detail as if it were the real deal.</p>

    <p>For the names of the Purchasers I put: The Most Perfect Family or Better</p>

    <p>For the price, I put in my walk away price:  $XXX,XXX.XX or Better</p>

    <p>For the date of possession I wrote the date and added: or Better</p>

    <p>I signed it as the Seller and signed it for the Purchaser as The Most Perfect Family 
      or Better.</p>

    <p>Then put the document away and let the energy flow!</p>

    <p>I'd love this next sentence to read, "And after I put my pen down my agent called …"</p>

    <p>Alas, the phone did not ring right away, although how cool would that have been!</p>

    <p>Months later there was a family celebration planned in Canada that we wanted to attend. 
      The timing of the event coincided with a school holiday. However, to justify traveling 
      that distance, I wanted to extend our stay, which exceeded the girls’ school break.  
      I had to apply for the girls’ absence well in advance.</p>

    <p>The application form asked, “Why do you require the children to be out of school outside 
      of normal holidays?”</p>

    <p>My answer, “We sold our house in Canada and needed to go back to move out.”</p>

    <p>Which technically was not exactly true, but my intention was for it to BE TRUE.</p>

    <p>This really amped up my energy by way of believing it!  Every time the school break 
      came up in conversation, I told people we were going to Canada to move out of the house!  
      Yes I was affirming it!</p>

    <p>Three weeks before we left for Canada, I received an offer to purchase that ticked all 
      of our boxes, and I eagerly accepted.</p>

    <p>And, yes I did a little jig!</p>

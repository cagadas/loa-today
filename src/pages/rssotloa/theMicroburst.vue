    <h5 class="h5 bottom0">The Microburst</h5>
    <h6 class="h6">by Walt Thiessen</h6>

    <p>I don't remember exactly which year it was, but it was one of the last couple 
      years we will lived in Virginia. That would make it 2012 or 2013.</p>

    <p>I was working in my office in one of the spare bedrooms of our house just 
      outside of Warrenton, Virginia. Rumors of possible tornado activity had surfaced, 
      and I periodically double-checked the online weather forecasts to make sure 
      nothing was developing in our area.</p>

    <p>By late afternoon, a number of small storms, often known as microbursts, began 
      to form in our area. A microburst is a sudden, powerful, localized air current, 
      especially a downdraft. It can be destructive like a tornado, but it doesn’t 
      cover as large of an area.</p>

    <p>When I checked the radar map and ran the tracking animation to watch the progress 
      of the storms, I realized that one of the worst ones was headed right toward our 
      house.</p>

    <p>Zooming in, I discovered that our house would be smack dab in the center of the 
      projected path of that storm. The National Weather Service issued a tornado watch 
      for our area.</p>

    <p>According to the radar map, we had maybe 5 to 10 minutes before the storm would 
      rush through our area.</p>

    <p>Louise was working on something in the living room, and I called out to her that 
      we needed to, “do our weather thing again.”</p>

    <p>We both began to visualize our favorite ideal weather patterns in our minds.</p>

    <p>My favorite weather pattern is one where there are blue skies with a gorgeous sun, 
      little puffy white clouds, and temperatures in the upper 60s to lower 70s.</p>

    <p>I spent a few minutes on that image, making it as clear in my mind as I could, 
      while believing mightily that it would come to pass. I also made sure that I got 
      really excited about the prospect of the weather changing to my desired alternative .</p>

    <p>This was just the second occasion that I could ever remember since we had learned 
      about the Law of Attraction trying to influence a storm intentionally, and it was 
      the first time that the storm was really dangerous, just minutes away.</p>

    <p>Our Old Town Alexandria day trip Louise told you about didn’t have a microburst 
      &ndash; just a cloudy and rainy day. So I was really curious to find out what would 
      happen this time.</p>

    <p>After I finished my visualization and let it go to the Universe, I walked outside 
      to see what was going on.</p>

    <p>We lived in a house on a one-acre plot in a rural setting, surrounded by trees in 
      all directions. Everywhere I looked, I could see trees bending fiercely in the wind 
      as far off as I could see.</p>

    <p>The only exceptions were the trees within our property line. Those branches barely 
      moved, swaying gently if at all. I half smiled at that, thinking it was noteworthy.</p>

    <p>I called Louise to come out and take a look herself.</p>

    <p>As we watched the sky above us, it started to clear. I don't mean the whole sky. 
      I mean only the part of the sky directly above our house changed. The rest of the 
      sky remained gray and threatening.</p>

    <p>It was like the heavens had carved out a hole in the storm right where we stood. 
      This was getting really weird!</p>

    <p>I must have stood out there for up to 10 minutes watching the storm as it bypassed 
      us on all sides. When nothing else seemed to happen other than the blowing of the 
      trees, I finally lost interest and walked back inside the house.</p>

    <p>The next day, Louise and I got in the car to drive into town to run some errands. 
      We decided to check out the neighborhood to see if there had been any damage from 
      the storm.</p>

    <p>Within about a half mile of our house in all directions, there was no damage at 
      all. But beyond that radius, no matter which direction we drove, we saw trees, 
      large branches, and even a telephone pole down.</p>

    <p>The extent of the damage was astonishing!</p>

    <p>We later learned that our part of the county had been hit hard by this microburst. 
      Only the island of our little neighborhood was spared any damage at all.</p>

    <p>If I needed any confirmation that we have the ability to influence the weather, 
      I got it that day.</p>

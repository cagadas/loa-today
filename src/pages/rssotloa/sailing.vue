    <h5 class="h5 bottom0">Sailing</h5>
    <h6 class="h6">by Cambria Berger</h6>

    <p>Follow your happiness. That phrase is something that I used to say often as a carefree 
      college student with her whole life ahead of her and a history of loving family and solid 
      friends.</p>

    <p>Little did I realize just how much that sentiment would shape the rest of my life and, 
      more specifically, the year following my college graduation.</p>

    <p>Since my teenage years, I had always been a bit of a dreamer with a love of the outdoors 
      and adventure. In college I became fast friends with a fellow with sailing in his blood. 
      His grandparents were sailors, and his cool demeanor and quick mind convinced me that that 
      was the sailor’s way.</p>

    <p>Since we lived in the rugged part of Northern California – practically in Oregon – his 
      fanciful warm water sailing stories seemed more like fantasy. His images of sunshine and 
      sea spray were a welcome distraction from the cold and musty reality of the weather we 
      endured 70% of the year.</p>

    <p>The more he shared, the more I desired to be that brave and resourceful soul who would 
      cast off the lines and sail into a world of adventure and exploration. I could taste that 
      this was going to be a part of my future.</p>

    <p>Enter Robert … the man who would make my dreams come true! I was instantly attracted to 
      him. As I got to know him, I learned that he was building a massive 60-foot-long sailboat 
      a couple of towns over.</p>

    <p>Robert was a fascinating guy. He was welding the hull together himself and had grown up 
      in a Caribbean Island. He had sailing in his blood, as his grandfather was a Captain in 
      the Coast Guard. His father built sailboats, and being an island boy, he had a deep love 
      for the sea.</p>

    <p>We dated, schemed, dreamed, and worked to turn his hunk of steel into a glorious sailing 
      machine. But as time went on, and my days as a college student began to dwindle, it became 
      clear that Robert and I were not on the same timetable for setting sail. I was willing to 
      work with that, but then our relationship began to implode of its own accord.</p>

    <p>We partied more than worked, played more than schemed, and burned out as fast as we had 
      sparked in the beginning. I was crestfallen. I felt incredibly sad that the relationship 
      ended and mourned the death of my dream of sailing around the world … especially with 
      someone I cared deeply about.</p>

    <p>In the end, I had to leave. I lived in that small town for so long that my wings were 
      damp with the Northern Pacific rains and slow ways of a mountain town.</p>

    <p>I planned a trip to New Zealand with an old friend as a graduation gift to myself. At 
      least I had that to look forward to. It patched up my heart and stoked the dwindling 
      embers of a capricious life at sea.</p>

    <p>Footloose and fancy free in New Zealand with one of my best friends was a feeling of 
      expansion like I’d never known before. All of this “growing up” and becoming an “adult” 
      was supposed to be hard work, nose to the grindstone, sacrifice according to many.</p>

    <p>Granted, I was on vacation, and although a career and work life was imminent, I couldn’t 
      help but keep “follow your happiness” at the forefront of all of my decisions.</p>

    <p>I was responsible. I worked my way through college holding down 30 hours/week jobs and 
      15-18 units of science courses simultaneously. I worked since I was 15 years old. I 
      understood responsibility at a visceral level. Surely I had earned this vacation, and 
      deep inside I knew that this journey would open up my perspective on life and how to 
      live it to the fullest.</p>

    <p>The trip was nothing short of magical. My travel partner Rose and I ran track and cross 
      country together in high school. Part of a close-knit friend group from those days and 
      throughout college, we stayed close and visited one another regularly, even when seven 
      hours of driving time separated us.</p>

    <p>She was bubbly and had this constant sense of curiosity that I adored. As your friend, 
      she made you know that she was truly interested in you and everything that you were up 
      to. That curiosity also drove her to incredible academic heights.</p>

    <p>At the time that we traveled, she was between a rigorous undergraduate degree and an 
      imminent graduate program, taking a break. She was all about squeezing every last 
      delicious drop from our trip.</p>

    <p>As we explored New Zealand, we saved money where we could, opting for hikes and treks 
      into nature while going along with new friends on group adventures.</p>

    <p>We even found our way onto a sailboat for a few days! My taste for sailing around the 
      world bobbed back up to the surface. It turns out that it had been bubbling and gurgling 
      deep inside looking for a fissure, an opportunity to erupt into the ultimate adventure.</p>

    <p>We sailed for three days, though it was cold and wet, and the captain seemed to have 
      more interest in my friend than actually teaching us to sail. I had to let the immediate 
      fantasy go, hoping that the sailing life was growing closer.</p>

    <p>Our travels continued, but after some time my friend had to leave me. She scheduled one 
      month for the trip, but I scheduled two. I was sad to see her go, but our trip had been 
      incredible. We had marvelous synergy, got into epic adventures, and our friendship was 
      now closer than ever.</p>

    <p>Being on my own was a new kind of thrill, though admittedly not as carefree without a 
      second set of eyes and opinions. My money was running low, and I wondered how I could 
      pay for the last two weeks of my trip, since I barely had enough money to cover 
      accommodations.</p>

    <p>I put my “follow your happiness” theory in front of me, as I had in the past. I 
      comfortably moved from town to town safely.</p>

    <p>I even managed to find work in a restaurant for a couple of nights to pay for a diving 
      trip in the Milford Sound, which is an incredible glacier-formed fjord in the southern 
      part of the country.</p>

    <p>Slowly I made my way back up the eastern side of the South Island. Catching rides where 
      I could, I kept calculating how far my money would go, hoping to squeeze in one last 
      touristy excursion, though the thought occasionally occurred that I ought to turn tail 
      and head home a few days early.</p>

    <p>I landed in a little town called Nelson up at the top of the South Island. It was a 
      sleepy, sweet, and artsy town, and I figured it would be a great place to hang around 
      until I was ready to hop back up North to Auckland to conclude the trip.</p>

    <p>I caught a Sunday farmer’s market festival with folk music and sunshine. I rode a bike 
      through the streets imagining living in such a quiet little town. And then honestly, 
      a bit of boredom crept in. It was time to go.</p>

    <p>On departure day, I hemmed and hawed and dilly-dallied until it was almost too late to 
      go. I finally committed, and as I walked to the outskirts of town to catch my ride, I 
      walked past Cambria Street.</p>

    <p>Awesome! I had never seen a street sign with my name on it. Delighted by this detail, 
      my step lightened, and I figured that I must be on the right path.</p>

    <p>I got several blocks away before I realized that I really wished I had taken a photo. 
      I kept walking and then heard clearly in my head, “You may never walk this path again.” 
      I promptly turned around to take the photo.</p>

    <p>As I juggled my camera, a familiar voice called my name. I looked up to see an Israeli 
      fellow my travel partner and I had met at the beginning of our trip. He was gregarious 
      and kind, with a goofy grin, bushy dark hair, and an overgrown beard. He was also on his 
      bike.</p>

    <p>He and his friend (I could never remember their names!), who was equally as friendly 
      and likable with bushy blond hair and a struggling beard, were biking around the whole 
      of New Zealand. When my friend and I met them, they were just starting out. We talked 
      about routes and sights and listening to people tell them they were slightly crazy for 
      attempting such an endeavor. We adored them.</p>

    <p>We saw them all over the country, however only one at a time!  We’d roll into town and 
      there would be one of them asking if we had seen the other after they had gotten separated. 
      A few towns or days later we would see the other one, asking about the first. And so it 
      went, all over the country, six weeks of leapfrogging and near misses.</p>

    <p>So when he rode up to me, he excitedly told me they had finally reunited and were staying 
      just down the road in an amazing hostel where you could sleep in an actual bus, and didn’t 
      you know there was a party tonight, and I just had to be there!</p>

    <p>I laughed at his boyish ways and exuberant ramblings while instantly agreeing to join 
      them for the night at the hostel.</p>

    <p> followed him to the hostel, got settled in, and made plans to meet for drinks and the 
      party later. With a bit of down time, I decided to take a quick jaunt down to the 
      Internet café and report to my mother that my plans had changed. She was keeping tabs 
      on me, and I was diligent about notifying her of my movements.</p>

    <p>When I walked into the café, there was a flier posted on the wall that changed my life 
      forever. It was a black-and-white photo of a pirate ship (well it looked like a pirate 
      ship), that said “Crew Wanted, S/V Alvei; French Polynesia Contact Evan”. Hand written 
      below that was a local phone number and an email address.</p>

    <p>My heart stopped. Could I dare to dream about being a crew member on this incredible 
      ship? Immediately the chatter in my head began … you know the advisory board that lays 
      in wait to chime in on any major decision, or anytime you put yourself really out 
      there? Yes, them … they all woke up and started deliberating. Through it all, I had 
      this silly girlie giddy feeling inside like maybe this was it. Maybe I could go. My 
      dream could begin right here!</p>

    <p>It was not lost on me that the series of “coincidences” that put me in this place at 
      this time were nothing short of miraculous. Cautiously, I tempered my enthusiasm and 
      typed out an email to Evan, followed by one to my mom.</p>

    <p>Needless to say, that night I felt restless, yet cautious. I couldn’t see how this 
      was going to work, but what I knew down to the core of me was that I was going to do 
      whatever it took to make it work!</p>

    <p>The next morning, I rushed over to the Internet café to see if Evan had responded. 
      Dashed by finding no response, I brightened to learn that my mom, who though she 
      expressed concern like a mother can do, said she was also excited to learn what it 
      was all about.</p>

    <p>Now what? I was too excited to sit around, so I made my way down to the docks in 
      search of the ship.</p>

    <p>Nelson is known as the maritime gateway of New Zealand. It is perfectly situated 
      for many commercial and private boats to have a protected place to tie up, because 
      it is located directly top and center between the two islands. As I strolled along 
      a marina filled with sailboats, my heart began to sink. I didn’t see the masts that 
      would surely tower over all of these others.</p>

    <p>I asked a fella walking down the docks, and he told me that he thought that the 
      ship had departed. My heart kept sinking. The ‘opposed’ members of my advisory 
      board smirked. But that fire deep inside of me still burned, and that little girlie 
      dreamer demanded that I not give up that easily.</p>

    <p>I wandered a bit more. Another fellow came down the dock, and I asked him as well. 
      He told me that he thought the ship was on the other side of the buildings at the 
      commercial dock. Quickly I walked up and around, and there she was! Her masts stood 
      tall and proud among the metal smoke stacks and tall bridges of the cargo ships 
      docked there. As I neared, I saw several confident young people working on and off 
      of the S/V Alvei. They smiled, and when I asked, they found Captain Evan for me.</p>

    <p>Evan was lanky and tanned with a knowing look in his eye. He told me that he hadn’t 
      checked his email recently as they had planned to leave yesterday, However they were 
      waiting on a delivery of engine spares that was due to come in that day or the next. 
      The next day was Friday though, and sailors (suspicious lot that they are) never set 
      sail on a Friday.</p>

    <p>He did still have room for one more crew member. If I signed on as crew, he asked 
      for a 10 month commitment, to return the ship to this port after sailing through the 
      South Pacific Islands. He took on passengers as his ship was sort of a combination 
      floating hostel/ learn to sail/ life of a traditional sailor training program.</p>

    <p>The ship was a ‘gaff rigged top sail schooner’. She was 126 feet overall length and 
      82 feet on the water. There was no running hot water, no refrigeration, all 15 sails, 
      and the anchor had to be raised and lowered by hand (well several sets of hands).</p>

    <p>Everyone was expected to do their share. I wouldn’t be paid. It was all volunteer work, 
      but he would waive the $25 per day fee everyone else was paying. I just had to post a 
      bond in Tahiti of $700 as a part of their immigration process, and the money would be 
      returned when we departed the country.</p>

    <p>Holy smokes! I was SO up for that! Living in Northern California when I was at college, 
      my campus was literally in a Redwood forest. I loved camping and roughing it. I loved 
      the physical challenges of hiking and crossing rivers, much as I had loved surfing and 
      playing in the beaches of my home in San Diego.</p>

    <p>Having exchanged pleasantries with some of the other crew members and passengers, I 
      knew that I could quite easily live and work with them. I just had to see about the 
      money and handle the details of my life back at home.</p>

    <p>Rushing back to the Internet café, I’m not sure if my feet even touched the ground!  
      I nervously dialed my mom. My parents were going to have to help me with the money. 
      I had $200 left to my name, and I needed $25 of that to change my plane ticket to get 
      back to the US.</p>

    <p>As luck would have it, and at the end of a very intense conversation, my mom told me 
      that she had just received her tax return and would be happy to lend it to me, even 
      though I knew it was a stretch for her. She agreed to care for my little dog, and my 
      dad agreed to take on payments for my student loan and my storage unit.</p>

    <p>Exhilaration was redefined for me that day. Two days later we sailed. The trajectory 
      of my life changed forever.</p>

    <p>In the ten months that followed that I lived on the S/V Alvei, I fell in love with 
      the sea. It enraptured me. I became enchanted with slowly watching land rise up from 
      the sea and take form as the next paradise to be explored.</p>

    <p>Fruit never tasted so sweet as when pulled fresh off the trees. The smiles and 
      generosity of locals, expats, and fellow sailors settled into my soul as a knowing 
      of “this is how people are meant to be with one another.” Any ideas about sitting 
      at a desk for the rest of my life disappeared.</p>

    <p>I became a sailor that year. The stories and experiences of those island hopping days 
      are a novel all their own.</p>

    <p>In the 13 years since, my itchy feet have touched 15 countries, and I spent close to 
      three years of my life with the rolling deck of a ship beneath my feet as a research 
      technician for a prominent oceanographic institution. I successfully combined my love 
      for the sea and being aboard a ship with my oceanography degree.</p>

    <p>Follow your happiness. I am so glad that I did.</p>

    <h6 class="h6">by Leslie Shew</h6>

    <p>It was our last day at the beach, and my friends were still sound asleep. The weather 
      was perfect. I wanted to get in a morning run while it was still quiet outside, but 
      also wanted to meditate and journal a little. I made the decision to journal first and 
      write down what was whirling around in my head to maybe bring some order to my thoughts.</p>

    <p>I came here to get away, attempting to escape the pain from previous months. My life 
      had recently been turned upside down in the most difficult year I could remember. It 
      was not the first time I faced serious adversity, but this was different. Recent 
      failures and set-backs unleashed my deepest fears, and I was now forced to deal with 
      them once and for all … only I felt alone this time.</p>

    <p>The ocean has always been a source of comfort to me. It’s so godlike in it’s magnificent 
      power and beauty: intimidating, mysterious, yet calming to my soul.</p>

    <p>I embraced the opportunity to face my darkest fears and sadness through the power of 
      meditation. I understood that what we think about creates our emotions and reality, but 
      there was still a part of me that challenged Law of Attraction principles.</p>

    <p>I guess you could call it disbelief. Attraction Law didn’t align with my strict 
      religious upbringing … or did it? Perhaps the basic concepts and beliefs are just 
      packaged differently. Either way, there was something I wanted to fully trust, yet 
      I was still a bit skeptical.</p>

    <p>I sat and journaled about what I wanted my life to look like when I got back to the 
      real world. I wrote about what I wanted to manifest, what I wanted to feel, and who 
      I wanted to be. I wondered: is it really as simple as shifting my belief? Decide what 
      I want and focus on that until it manifests? Is it really possible?</p>

    <p>It seemed simple when listening to the gurus who lived out their dreams and desires 
      in their own personal lives of manifested creation. According to these masters of 
      manifestation, thoughts would manifest whether I believed it to be true or not, but 
      what if it didn't apply to me somehow? I mean, who am I to have the kind of power 
      to create what I desire in my life, to evoke the emotions I want to feel instead of 
      the ones that imprisoned me since childhood?</p>

    <p>It seemed that lots of people were capable of making this powerful shift in mindset, 
      so maybe it was real.</p>

    <p>I had recently studied Dr. Joe Dispenza and his research into the power of the mind 
      and manifesting your desired reality through meditation. For the first time in my 
      life, I began meditating. It was not easy at the beginning, mind you. My life was a 
      hot mess, and my mind was full of even more chaos and craziness. Attempting to quiet 
      the voices inside my head was becoming a full time job.</p>

    <p>However, I was determined. I wanted to see if meditation really worked and remembered 
      hearing a powerful testimonial from a woman at one of the workshops I had attended who 
      manifested seeing a red balloon while practicing a walking meditation on the beach. 
      I rolled my eyes when I first heard it, but as the story unfolded, I found myself 
      intrigued. What would be the point of manifesting a stupid balloon? That seemed like 
      a lot of work for something insignificant. Why not try and manifest a hundred dollar 
      bill or something more useful?</p>

    <p>I obviously missed the point about how it wasn’t what's manifested but rather the 
      fact that it happened that matters. The woman believed she could do it, and she did. 
      Many people around her watched it unfold. She couldn’t deny the truth. I eventually 
      thought, "Good for her for picking something so outlandish to manifest that her mind 
      couldn’t rationalize it away."</p>

    <p>That's when everything changed for me.</p>

    <p>I hopped out of bed, put on my running shoes, and decided to finish my quiet time 
      alongside the ocean, my happy place.</p>

    <p>I stepped outside where the smell of salt in the air, the warm breeze coming off 
      the ocean, and the sounds of sea gulls fighting over their morning meal hit me in 
      the face.</p>

    <p>I put on my headphones, turned up the volume, and began to lose myself in my music 
      and thoughts. The only thing that would have been more perfect would be to run with 
      my eyes closed as I felt the warm sun beaming down on my face.</p>

    <p>I smiled for the first time in a long while; you know, that deep smile that comes 
      from within your soul, the one that makes you feel in the moment that things will 
      be okay.</p>

    <p>I have always loved running on the beach. I love to see who is out so early in 
      the morning … the other joggers and walkers ... the early risers dragging their 
      beach chairs and coolers to the beach while the rest of their crew sleeps off the 
      rum runners from the night before … the fishermen determined to catch a yummy lunch 
      or just enjoying the peace and quiet.</p>

    <p>Just as I began to enjoy this welcome peace in my soul, my subconscious mind bullied 
      it’s way in to remind me of my past emotions, the ones that keep me paralyzed, the 
      ones that are so familiar and in some strange way, comforting.</p>

    <p>At first I thought I could just run harder and maybe that would shake them off. 
      If I turned up my music, then maybe I couldn’t hear them any more.</p>

    <p>Dangit. Here came the tears, the feeling of loneliness, the despair, the regrets, 
      the fears, the shame. It was like they all played in unison, joining forces to 
      disrupt the few minutes of peace I had found in my morning of triumph.</p>

    <p>How can the mind shift so quickly? And if it can happen so easily then how in the 
      world would I ever experience true and lasting change?</p>

    <p>Maybe all this stuff is just bullshit. Maybe this Law of Attraction and meditation 
      talk was just for gurus and yogis … or maybe all of those people were just being 
      scammed and brainwashed.</p>

    <p>Ironically, I have since come to realize that I was the one being brainwashed by 
      my own subconscious mind, by my own demons, my repetitive thoughts and beliefs that 
      had brought me to this place in my life to begin with.</p>

    <p>I decided to do an experiment. What did I have to lose?</p>

    <p>One of the happiest memories of my entire life was when my husband took me to swim 
      with the dolphins for my birthday a few years prior.</p>

    <p>As a teenager, I had dreamed of working with dolphins. You know, one of the marine 
      biologist folks who get to train them, study them, teach them sign language, and 
      whatever else they do. I didn’t care, as long as I could just be in their presence. 
      I had actually never seen one up close, other than the ones who swam in front of 
      the boats when I would go on dolphin watches. But there was just something about 
      them that captivated me.</p>

    <p>Being in the water with them was such an incredible experience. The energy coming 
      off the dolphins was intensely beautiful and invigorating. They made me laugh, smile, 
      and cry all at the same time. It was literally the most amazing thing I had ever 
      done and in that moment I felt more alive and happier than at any other moment in 
      my entire life as I experienced the feeling of a powerful energy that is indescribable.</p>

    <p>I began smiling just thinking about it. I remembered Dr. Joe say that to manifest 
      something you must feel the emotions that you will feel when it becomes your reality.</p>

    <p>So, I halfway closed my eyes and began to feel that energy and happiness I wanted, 
      the feelings I had felt years before. I began imagining seeing a dolphin swim up to 
      the shoreline and giving me a “fins up” that everything was going to be okay.</p>

    <p>Immediately my subconscious mind began sending back “hell no” thoughts.</p>

    <p>The first one was, <em>Leslie, you have been coming to this beach since you were a 
      child and have never once seen a dolphin in these waters. So what makes you think 
      you will see one today?</em></p>

    <p>But I knew they were there ... it’s the damn ocean! I knew they were in there, 
      and if a woman can manifest a silly red balloon for God’s sake, then surely I can 
      manifest something that actually lives.</p>

    <p>I thought, <em>Okay, maybe, but you might have to sit and watch for a while. I mean, 
      do you really think it’s just going to happen right away just because you are willing 
      it to happen with your newly discovered mind powers?</em></p>

    <p><em>Why not,</em> I answered myself. <em>I will even ask God to help me. He loves 
      me and wants me to see that I have the ability to do it, so maybe I will ask Him to 
      throw in a little help from above.</em></p>

    <p>So, I did. I prayed to God and asked if He would just do this. Give me a sign that 
      I’m on the right path and that things were going to be okay.</p>

    <p>I approached the end of the boardwalk and stopped to lean over the wood railing to 
      look out at the ocean. I saw a guy feeding the seagulls, a couple walking on the beach, 
      and a man fishing on the edge of the water. It was beautiful and calm.</p>

    <p>The ocean looked like a glass floor. It was almost still. The sunrise was stunning. 
      I took a deep breath and waited.</p>

    <p>In what seemed like only half a second, I saw him. A single dolphin leapt out of the 
      water right in front of me!</p>

    <p>I literally began laughing out loud and jumped up and down. I couldn’t believe what 
      I was seeing. And it wasn’t a pair of dolphins, which is what you would normally see, 
      it was just one single dolphin swimming alone, dancing his way towards me as though 
      he could tell that I had seen him.</p>

    <p>He immediately turned around and swam back into the ocean. I continued to smile, that 
      big hard smile I had when I had gone swimming with the dolphins years before.</p>

    <p>I thanked God and the dolphin out loud. I didn’t care who saw me or what they were 
      thinking. I had done it! We had done it!</p>

    <p>I guess this Law of Attraction thing is for real.</p>

    <p>I could barely see to get back to my condo from the tears pouring out of my eyes. 
      It felt like I floated back to the room. I couldn’t wait to write down what had 
      happened in my journal. I wanted to be able to preserve this manifestation and memory 
      feeling in my mindset arsenal for the next time my subconscious mind tried to tell 
      me I was a fool.</p>

    <p>Everything is going to be okay. I just have to keep believing in what I want to 
      have in my life. When I can see it in my mind and feel it in my heart, I see the 
      beauty of my desires manifest before my very eyes. The feeling is as beautiful as 
      watching a dolphin jumping for joy at sunrise.</p>

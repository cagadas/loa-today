    <h5 class="h5">London Calling</h5>
    <h6 class="h6">by Geanina Roman</h6>

    <p>The first time I visited London was during a three day trip. That was all I needed 
      to fall in love with the city. It wasn’t just the beauty of the place that drew me 
      in but also the feeling that I’d been there before. I remember sitting in line at the 
      airport. As I boarded the flight that would take me back home to Romania, wanted to 
      return so badly.</p>

    <p>Back home I had recently started a very promising full-time job. I was hired as a 
      translator by a prestigious company. This was the sort of job that sounded really 
      good on paper, particularly for a fresh graduate. I thought that I would be happy 
      as long as I was using my language skills. My previous experience as a volunteer 
      translator for cultural events during University made me feel confident about that.</p>

    <p>I didn’t take me long to realise that my new job, where I had to deal with soulless 
      technical details and monotonous press releases on a daily basis, was nothing like my 
      volunteering experience. I felt disconnected from my work. It felt hard, and I began 
      to doubt myself.</p>

    <p>I also missed the small town where I went to university and the friends I made there. 
      The lack of job opportunities there led me to move to a big city that felt cold and 
      unfriendly by contrast. I couldn’t find anything exciting at work or outside it. I 
      began to feel lost and too hopeless to even think about finding something better.</p>

    <p>Only my daily meditation practice prevented me from wallowing in anxiety and helped 
      me regain some of my balance.</p>

    <p>The thought of going back to London was always at the back of my mind. So a few months 
      later, the news that I was being made redundant came as a relief. It also came as a 
      permission slip to finally do something about my dream to go to the U.K.</p>

    <p>Exactly one year to the day from when I stood in line at the airport to leave Britain, 
      I found myself at the Arrivals at Heathrow ready to start my new life.</p>

    <p>That new life revolved around my job as an au pair. This meant that I lived with a 
      British family taking their children to school and helping out with household chores, 
      all in exchange for some pocket money, my own room, food, and no bills to pay.</p>

    <p>My schedule gave me plenty of time to do some soul searching and to explore London. 
      There was so much to see and do! I went to as many parks, galleries, cinemas, and 
      other sites that would allow me to visit. There was so much beauty around me and in 
      the people I met. Everywhere I went I experienced an underlying feeling that anything 
      was possible, that I was supported no matter what. It was so easy to be myself in London, 
      and I had a familiar feeling of belonging there.</p>

    <p>During this time, a deep knowing came to me. I discovered that my thoughts and the 
      things I give my attention to create the events in my life. For example, my strong 
      thoughts about Britain brought me there, and I realised that landing there on the 
      exact same day one year after I made the wish couldn’t have been just a coincidence.</p>

    <p>Also my love of the English language that I’d acquired from a young age when I 
      watched Scooby-Doo on TV must have influenced me to end up in Britain. The deep 
      feeling of peace that I experienced in Britain matched perfectly the feeling I’d 
      practised during my meditations before I arrived.</p>

    <p>I came across a book on the Law of Attraction by Abraham-Hicks, and although a bit 
      doubtful about some of its claims, I decided to buy it. Idea after idea presented 
      in the book resonated with me in a way that nothing did before then. The Law of Attraction 
      became my life philosophy as I learned how to shift my thoughts to create happy 
      experiences as my self-confidence grew with every day.</p>

    <p>Living in London was the most joyful thing I could imagine. I wanted to stay there 
      for as long as possible. But in order to do that, I needed a different job, one that 
      would give me a proper salary and thus more freedom to be more than just a guest in 
      another family’s house, no matter how kind and friendly they were to me.</p>

    <p>My interests were scattered, and my work experience was limited. I had no idea how 
      I could use them to get a good job.</p>

    <p>The most interesting experience I had was volunteering for cultural events while I 
      was still a student. I acted as a guide for tourists and for other volunteers, 
      translated movie scripts, and offered information to festival goers, among other things.</p>

    <p>I loved working behind the scenes in events related to the cinema and the theatre 
      because of their ability to transport the audience to new places. It felt good to 
      contribute to that purpose in my own way. As for my other skills, my previous work 
      as a translator wasn’t particularly helpful because Romanian isn’t exactly a sought 
      after language in Britain (or anywhere else!)</p>

    <p>As an au pair I learned that I loved children, and I would have liked my dream job 
      to involve them somehow. But my au pair job was too informal, and it didn’t qualify 
      me to work with children in an institution.</p>

    <p>Nor did I have the finances to study and eventually obtain such a qualification. All 
      I knew for sure was that I had good administrative skills so, that’s what I applied for: 
      any job that would make use of them. The more I thought about it, getting a job I liked 
      seemed hard.</p>

    <p>Could I find something I enjoyed doing despite my lack of experience? Where could I 
      find this job? Would it mean starting from the bottom and thus having to put up with 
      some shortage?</p>

    <p>Those questions went through my mind as I started my search. Thinking about them brought 
      a lot of the old anxiety back, and there were many times when I had to remind myself 
      that the Law of Attraction expands anything I focus on.</p>

    <p>Lack wasn’t what I wanted, so I did my best to snap myself out of negative patterns. 
      Instead, I remembered how the Universe orchestrated my arrival in London, how it 
      brought me to my wonderful au pair family, how easily it helped me meet people who 
      encouraged me, including a boyfriend. The Universe had already brought to me so many 
      things that made me happy. Surely, my dream of staying in London must have been heard 
      too.</p>

    <p>The first time I realised that something was beginning to manifest was when I got a 
      call from what sounded like a potential employer. Except that I was in a place with 
      poor reception and I could hardly hear what the caller was saying. I hung up 
      disappointed, unable to reach them back.</p>

    <p>That seemed like an awful start to my search. I felt sad, but I tried to remember 
      Abraham’s words about there being more than one opportunity lined up for each desire. 
      So that if you miss one, there’s always another one around the corner. This helped 
      me keep my hopes high.</p>

    <p>Once, more or less randomly, I applied at a big entertainment company only to get a 
      rejection email, politely saying that they don’t need anyone with my skills at the 
      moment. Again, I tried to see it as just another opportunity to keep focused on what 
      I wanted and to ignore any evidence of the opposite.</p>

    <p>So I kept visualising the expansive and exhilarating feeling of embracing London more 
      and more, having fun there, meeting more interesting people, going to a job I loved 
      where I felt at ease and happy. My daydreams were as real as I could make them.</p>

    <p>About two months later, I found myself sitting in the office of an employment agency 
      whose furniture was exactly like what I’d visualised. I couldn’t help but smile. At 
      the same time, I was also blown away by how I got there to begin with: I was headhunted!</p>

    <p>The lady sitting in front of me had been looking for someone with my language skills 
      for a while, and she was wondering if I’d like to interview with a big broadcasting 
      company.</p>

    <p>Soon afterward, as I walked through the building of the company for my interview, 
      I was in awe and a bit star struck because this is where my favourite cartoons as a 
      child were broadcast from. The walls were covered in posters of Scooby, Tom & Jerry, 
      Dexter’s Lab, and many others. I thought to myself: <em>How cool is that?! Even if 
      I don’t get the job, I’m just happy to be here!</em></p>

    <p>It was the only interview I went to during my job search and the only one that I 
      needed. Shortly afterwards, they offered me the job, and I accepted it. Despite the 
      fact that I didn’t have any experience in broadcasting, they were happy to train me 
      because I was a Romanian speaker and because as a student I used to volunteer for a 
      film studio.</p>

    <p>My main responsibility was scheduling the children’s TV channel that went out to 
      Romania, the same one I learned English from as a child! This meant so much to me 
      because I could contribute to making other children happy too. It made use of my 
      organising skills as I had to put together programs, trailers, and commercials 
      into a schedule according to broadcasting rules before I delivered them to 
      Transmission. It was also fun to use my language skills as I had to check and 
      edit scripts for trailers and also watch programs and graphics to make sure they 
      were in the right language.</p>

    <p>Everything else lined up in a way that met all my needs at the time too. It was an 
      office job in central London, in a building filled with toys that reminded me of 
      childhood and fun. The pay was even higher than what I asked. The work environment 
      was positive, and my manager taught me so many things, appreciated my work, gave me 
      a raise a year later.</p>

    <p>I’ve been living in London for a few years now, and I still can’t get over how 
      perfectly the Universe brought together so many aspects of what I wanted and needed 
      then. It felt like a nod to carry on following my joy because I was on the right track.</p>

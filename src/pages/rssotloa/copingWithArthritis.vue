    <h5 class="h5 bottom0">Coping with Arthritis</h5>
    <h6 class="h6">by Tarryn Tomlinson</h6>

    <p>The pain was unbearable, sometimes stabbing and hot, other times dull and 
      throbbing. The doctors said there was no cure for the arthritis that ravaged 
      my joints. I took the medication, but it did nothing much for the pain and 
      discomfort. Not being one to take the opinions of others as law, I decided 
      to research this affliction and how I could go about getting some relief.</p>

    <p>I had always believed that the mind was powerful and that life was far more 
      magical than what I had been experiencing. I took the practical approach to 
      attempt to heal the illness; I changed my diet, took homeopathic meds, tried 
      acupuncture, went for body alignment and yoga. I tried just about anything 
      and everything, and it helped to a marginal degree. Over the years the disease 
      slowed down, and the pain lessened, but it was the mental work that got me 
      through the worst of it.</p>

    <p>I intensely studied the mind-body connection, my emotions, the power of positive 
      thinking, the perils of negative thinking, and the Universe at large. I believed 
      that our bodies and lives are the result of our thoughts and set about understanding 
      my route to constant physical pain.</p>

    <p>In 2007, things clicked for me in a big way. I had heard of the Law of Attraction 
      and had studied books on creative visualization, but only after I watched The Secret 
      did the simplicity of it all became apparent. The documentary in itself was a 
      confirmation of all that I have learned up until that point. Cutting away the 
      philosophy and mysticism introduced me to the simple three step process: Ask, 
      Believe, Receive.</p>

    <p>There is a point in the documentary when one of the teachers speaks of how he decided 
      to set a big goal for himself, one so big that if he achieved it, he would know it was 
      only because of what he had learned. I decided to do the same.</p>

    <p>However, I never concentrated on walking. What set my heart on fire was the idea of 
      going to live in Italy. For a long time I felt guilty about not concentrating on my 
      health but later came to understand that if a topic is too emotionally charged and 
      brings up too many fears it is best to get off the subject. The thought of living in 
      Italy felt free of the past, the pain, and the limitations. It brought me joy to think 
      about visiting Italy and excited me. I needed something to feel excited about.</p>

    <p>I decided that I wanted to visit Italy, but not just to go on a holiday. I wanted to 
      stay there for longer than a year, and I wanted to live in absolute luxury. I wanted 
      to experience the best Italy had to offer, because if what I was learning was the 
      truth, if the natural state of the Universe is one of abundance, and if any experienced 
      limitation was just a product of my own thoughts, then there was no reason why I should 
      not experience abundance on my trip.</p>

    <p>Dreams are beautiful things. They give you hope and make you live out in fantasy what 
      seems so far from reality. The reality of my situation at that time was that I was 
      wheelchair-bound with no source of income, no job, and no trust fund. There was 
      absolutely nothing in my reality that even resembled my dream, but I did not let that 
      stop me.</p>

    <p>I re-watched <em>The Secret</em> and did my journaling work on a daily basis. Each time 
      I watched the documentary, I carried myself away during that hour in complete belief. 
      The journaling helped me to process emotion and understand what I was thinking. I 
      used it each day to write down my affirmations.</p>

    <p>Months passed, months of watching, writing, believing, and standing guard over my 
      thoughts. I would be lying to you if I said I had perfect faith. I just gave it the 
      best attempt I could.</p>

    <p>I started watching <em>The Secret</em> in August, and by the time December came 
    around I had reached the height of my frustration. You could hear a pin drop in the
     silence of the nothingness the Universe presented to me. I remember sitting on my 
     chair in my mother's room, crying because all I wanted to do was to go to Italy, and 
     all my mental work was producing nothing.</p>

    <p>My mom hugged me and wiped my tears as she tried to alleviate my heartbreak. She then 
    decided that we would go to Italy together. She had leave coming to her the following 
    year in June, and we could go for 18 days then. Though this immediately eased my hurt, 
    I still had to figure out how to get my airfare, and 18 days was not what I asked for.</p>

    <p>Being desperate to get to Italy, this small move in the right direction to me was a 
      great relief. The money for the airfare quickly manifested when my aunt, who had 
      promised to purchase me a plane ticket years prior, made good on her promise.</p>

    <p>It was not until sometime towards the end of January of the following year that 
      something spooky started to take place.</p>

    <p>It was late in the afternoon, and I was going to have a bath. I decided to take my 
      phone with me into the bathroom, and I turned it on to listen to my messages. The 
      first voice I heard was that of a man: “Hi Tarryn. You don’t know me. My name is 
      Mike, and I am a friend of Nadia’s. She is not sure if you remember her, but she 
      asked me to contact you and pass on her details. She has some information about 
      your health.”</p>

    <p>Nadia was an acquaintance I had met four years prior. She contacted me from Paris, 
      saying that she had some news about my health. There was some type of natural 
      medication that was said would help decrease inflammation and abate the disease. 
      She had access to this medication because she worked at UNESCO for a well known 
      virologist, the very man who discovered HIV back in the 1980s. The problem was 
      that they could not send the medication to me because it was still in its trial 
      phase. I needed to go to Paris in order to have it administered.</p>

    <p>Though the offer was one worth trying, I simply didn’t have the funds to go to 
      Paris and financially look after myself for a month. I communicated this to her 
      and said that I planned to come to Italy in June/July. It just so happened that 
      they would be in Italy around the same time and could meet up with me to give me 
      the medication.</p>

    <p>Something was brewing in the Universe. I just didn’t know what or how all the 
      pieces would fit together.</p>

    <p>My first trip to Italy with my mom and friends was amazing. I remember the Trevi 
      fountain like it was yesterday. Rome on any given day is packed with tourists, and 
      that day around the Trevi fountain a horde of tourists stood to take in the magic
      of the place, and of course to take pictures. A friend suggested that I throw a 
      coin into the fountain. Apparently, if you throw a coin in, you will come back to 
      Rome. I simple shrugged it off telling him that I do not have money to waste. I 
      knew I was coming back.</p>

    <p>The fateful day arrived when Nadia and her boss came to meet me at my hotel room. 
      What an honour to meet face to face with such a great mind! Professor Montagnier 
      and Nadia sat down with my mother and I to explain the medication, reminding us 
      that it might or might not help, suggesting that it would be worth a try.</p>

    <p>It was the second-to-last day of my stay in Italy. At one point in our conversations, 
      Nadia turned to me, and with her excitable French accent said, “But Tarryn, you know 
      that you cannot go? You have to stay here in Italy.” She looked at her boss and said, 
      “Professor! Tell her!”</p>

    <p>After asking Nadia to calm down began, Professor Montagnier said the words I had 
      been praying to hear.</p>

    <p>“There is a possibility for you to stay in Italy. I know of a man who is a very 
      famous song writer who also has a type of arthritis like yours. He healed himself 
      with diet and a number of treatments and is now doing a trial on his estate. Maybe 
      we can talk to him about you being one of the candidates for the trial.”</p>

    <p>As cliché as it may sound, time stood still. I do not remember breathing very much 
      as each and every hair stood up on my arms. Listening with such intensity to what he 
      said, all my senses became heightened as competing thoughts were drowned out. It felt 
      like I was in the eye of a storm in my mind.</p>

    <p><em>This is it!</em> I thought. <strong><em>This is it.</em></strong></p>

    <p>After the moment passed and my mind reactivated with expressions of joy, I told 
      them that I simply could not stay as I had a Visa that was about to expire and 
      roughly 10 Euros left to my name.</p>

    <p>Both Nadia and the Professor suggested I return to South Africa, while they would 
      see what they could do from their end regarding the trial. A part of me disbelieved 
      it would work out. That censor voice said, “Don’t get your hopes up. You know how 
      people say stuff and do not follow through.”</p>

    <p>I did not allow that type of thinking to sink in. During the days that followed, 
      I argued against it, telling myself that I will not entertain negative thinking.</p>

    <p>My arrival back in South Africa was filled with wonder, gratitude, and excitement. 
      Instead of visualizing and affirming, I trusted that everything would work out 
      perfectly. I had put sufficient energy into the creation of what I wanted, and now 
      it was running of its own accord. I simply needed to trust.</p>

    <p>Four weeks after my arrival in South Africa, I ended up back on a plane to Rome. 
      I planned to stay in Umbria at the home of one of the most famous Italian lyricists 
      of all time, a man who goes by the name of Mogol. The estate is a sight to behold, 
      and I had everything I could possibly want and more.</p>

    <p>Close to midday, we finally drove the private road leading to the estate. The tall 
      trees hanging overhead provided shade as we drove down the winding road that led deeper 
      into the forest. I rolled down the window to feel the cool breeze caress my face, a 
      welcome reprieve from the stuffy, hot air of Rome.</p>

    <p>As a passenger, I had the luxury of taking it all in: the breeze, the shade, the 
      forest, and the other passengers in the car, one of them being the man who discovered 
      HIV. The chauffeur took the bend, and just like most things unexpected in Italy, a 
      huge clearing appeared ahead where I saw for the first time the magnificent estate 
      I would call home for what I thought would be a month. It took my breath away, and 
      as time slowed while the hairs rose on my arms, it dawned upon me that my
      manifestation far exceeded my dream.</p>

    <p>My first week there I made headline news in a national newspaper and was treated 
      like a celebrity. Professor Montagnier and my friend stayed with me the first week, 
      when he learned he had won the Nobel Prize for Medicine for his discovery of HIV.</p>

    <p>The treatment was best suited for people at the onset of arthritis, and too many 
      of my joints had been destroyed according to the doctors. They told me there was 
      nothing to be done. I was less than a month into my stay!</p>

    <p>I kept calm. A little while later, Mogol came to me with a proposal. He knew of a 
      good surgeon who could operate on me. I could stay on the estate, and he would 
      support me.</p>

    <p>The occurrences that followed are too numerous to mention. I traveled around Italy, 
      had amazing experiences, met fascinating people, and underwent two operations.</p>

    <p>When I returned to South Africa after close to two years living abroad, I did the 
      tally. The trip would have cost me about $150,000. I did not pay a cent out of my 
      own pocket. I am still wheelchair bound, but what is life without something to work 
      towards – something else to manifest?</p>

    <p>Since I have had this experience and manifested many other things, I have become 
      a coach. I also started a foundation for underprivileged kids by teaching them the 
      Law of Attraction.</p>

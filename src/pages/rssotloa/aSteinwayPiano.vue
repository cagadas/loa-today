    <h6 class="h6">by Anne-Marie McEwen</h6>

    <p>At the north end of Main Street in Middletown, Connecticut sits The Buttonwood 
      Tree, our beloved community arts center. It was named for its birthplace, once 
      known as the Avenue of the Buttonwoods.</p>

    <p>In 1989 Wesleyan University alumna named Susan Eastman Allison opened a used 
      bookstore, called the Ibis. It soon became a hub of activity where creativity 
      and community flourished.</p>

    <p>Besides being a bookstore, the Ibis became an informal gathering place for people 
      to share their ideas and talents. It bustled with activity and brought positive 
      energy to the neighborhood.</p>

    <p>Two years later the Ibis morphed into a nonprofit arts organization, North End 
      Arts Rising, while retaining its nickname, The Buttonwood Tree. It served the 
      community by offering books, poetry readings, and programs for personal enrichment 
      and the cultivation of artistic talent.</p>

    <p>Jump to February 2007.</p>

    <p>I found myself needing to “re-create” myself after my retirement from my career 
      as a dental hygienist and more recently from my business as a food truck operator. 
      I decided to volunteer in areas that interested me and see where it would lead me.</p>

    <p>In addition to serving Miles for Smiles and the Coalition for Children, I responded 
      to a newspaper ad looking for volunteers to help write grants for The Buttonwood 
      Tree. I had a brief, very positive experience years earlier with The Buttonwood Tree, 
      and knew they were about music and the arts. So I joined.</p>

    <p>Three months later, one of the people on the grant writing team, Kunle Mwanga, invited 
      me to join the Board of Directors for The Buttonwood Tree.</p>

    <p>My first board position!</p>

    <p>I accepted, not knowing what it entailed, but believing that they were doing good 
      work in the community. For about nine months I volunteered for all three organizations 
      and learned all about North End Arts Rising and The Buttonwood Tree.</p>

    <p>Simultaneously, I focused on learning and growing to make myself the best person I 
      could be, diving into reading all the <em>Conversations with God</em> books by Neale 
      Donald Walsch, Louise Hays’ <em>You Can Heal Your Life,</em> and studying the teachings 
      of Abraham books by Esther and Jerry Hicks.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, The Buttonwood Tree operated in low gear. Suffering from the economic 
      downturn and a lack of leadership after Susan Allison stepped down due to illness, 
      programming and funding reached their lowest ebb. I helped write some grants and 
      did my best to inject hope, but half of the board members wanted to shut our doors. 
      Our executive director stepped down to have a baby, and things looked dim.</p>

    <p>I resigned from everything but the North End Arts Rising board, then took a trip 
      to Hawaii to see my daughter. I stayed for six weeks. While there I was offered a 
      job to run a sustainable seafood “fast food” truck. I’d have jumped at the chance 
      if it weren’t in Hawaii, but I knew that my daughter wouldn’t be there very long, 
      and all my family was in Connecticut. I declined.</p>

    <p>Returning to The Buttonwood Tree, I learned that soon we’d have no executive director. 
      There had been much discussion about closing for months. At our next board meeting, 
      three directors voted to close down. Three others, including myself, voted to keep 
      our doors open. The only problem was that since we had no funds, one of us needed to 
      take over as executive director. As I voted to stay open, I felt the tug inside me 
      &ndash; a nudge and a knowing that said THIS was my new job.</p>

    <p>We all looked around the table in silence. It was a scary moment. I knew nothing 
      about administration and nonprofits. I had no qualifications or experience. But 
      knowing that my gut wouldn’t lead me astray, I said I would take the job.</p>

    <p>I told them I knew nothing and didn’t know if I was capable. John Basinger, the 
      president, looked at me reassuringly. He convinced me I could do it and offered to 
      mentor me, helping as much as I needed.</p>

    <p>My saving grace was that I had a passion for keeping The Buttonwood Tree open, with 
      some decent writing skills, a love for music, and an even deeper love for humanity 
      tossed in for good measure.</p>

    <p>As executive director, it’s my job to keep everything running smoothly, all systems 
      “go” you might say. I was in charge of everything from programs to posters, including 
      booking the acts, paying bills, and maintaining all the equipment.</p>

    <p>Over the years we held many poetry events and classes of all sorts from painting to 
      yoga. But the main focus of our arts programming was to provide concerts by local and 
      touring musicians.</p>

    <p>For a small arts organization, we had some good basic equipment in the music department, 
      a great sound system with top microphones.</p>

    <p>One item that was not quite up-to-par, however, was the piano. It was with great 
      distress that I would bring in world-class pianists to perform at The Buttonwood 
      Tree on a very inferior piano with various mechanical problems and issues with 
      tuning stability. Their performances would suffer as a result.</p>

    <p>Our piano tuner and repair man was one of the best in the area, Bruce MacLeod, 
      who would make repairs until it couldn’t be fixed anymore.</p>

    <p>At one concert the piano rolled away from the pianist! We had to laugh about it 
      at the time, and the pianist was more than cordial about it, but I was mortified.
      We needed another piano soon.</p>

    <p>In our small space, the issue of the piano often brought up the question: should 
      we get an upright instead of the baby grand that we had? Because we attracted 
      pianists due to having the piano, and the piano happened to be my favorite 
      instrument, I was emphatic about keeping the baby grand size. So Bruce bought a 
      rebuilt piano from his friend and did his best with it. That held up fairly well, 
      but it was still far from perfect.</p>

    <p>We are fortunate to have many world-class musicians at The Buttonwood Tree. One 
      music teacher, Carolyn Halsted, performed classical piano concerts at The Buttonwood 
      Tree occasionally throughout the years. After we had the piano rebuilt, I invited 
      her to play again. The concert was nice, and afterward I asked her to come back 
      some time. I’ll never forget her response. She said to me in the most gentle, kind 
      and sympathetic tone, “I’m sorry, but I can’t play that piano.” Her softened facial 
      expression revealed how painful playing it had been to her.</p>

    <p>That pain embedded in me a very strong desire to get a fantastic piano so she would 
      return and be happy to play at our place. I told her I’d do what I could to get 
      another piano and asked what kind of piano I should seek to be suitable both to her 
      and to the many other pianists we hosted. With humility and reserve, she sweetly 
      said that she had a Steinway at home.</p>

    <p>I could see in her eyes that she knew we couldn’t afford one and that we’d probably 
      never get a really good piano, but I felt otherwise. I felt hope and a drive to remedy 
      the situation. In that moment I vowed to myself to get a good piano, one she deserved 
      to play on, worthy of the very best pianists in the world &ndash; a Steinway.</p>

    <p>The next day I added “a Steinway” to our online wish list. I talked with our piano tuner 
      and told him that I wanted a Steinway. He chuckled, and said it would never happen.</p>

    <p>I replied, “I can hope can’t I?”</p>

    <p>He smiled and nodded, “Of course, you can. Good luck with that.”</p>

    <p>So I hoped. I imagined having happy pianists, and I talked about it with anyone who 
      would listen.</p>

    <p>Concerts came and went. Pianists asked to perform, and I’d turn many of them down, 
      saying some day when we have a better piano we would be happy to host them. When I 
      stood in front of the audience, welcoming them and introducing the musicians, I’d 
      tell them that we are hoping one day to get a Steinway piano for these wonderful 
      pianists.</p>

    <p>I put the word out that we wanted a new piano, preferably a Steinway, and my passion 
      for it never died. We actually got several calls from people offering pianos, but their 
      pianos were no better than what we already had.</p>

    <p>Concerts came and went.</p>

    <p>Three years later, in early September I received an interesting phone call from a 
      gentleman who lived about an hour away. Steve Gorden was moving and had a piano he 
      couldn’t fit into his new home. Though he had someone who offered to purchase it, 
      he wanted to know who we were and what we would do with the piano.</p>

    <p>After having fielded several such calls in the past, I learned that many people 
      just wanted someone to take their piano away. Being cautious, I asked about his 
      piano and its condition. It turned out his was a Steinway in perfect condition! 
      I was thrilled at the possibility.</p>

    <p>He wanted his piano to go to a good home where it would be played often and 
      appreciated by many. We spoke for 45 minutes all about The Buttonwood Tree and 
      how we serve the community, who would be using the piano, who our performers are, 
      and all the other details. He said he would think about it and talk to some people 
      about our organization and then call me.</p>

    <p>I waited with bated breath but felt deep down: this was it. I could sense it 
      happening … and it felt so exciting!</p>

    <p>A few days later Steve called back and confirmed he would give us the piano. 
      I was ecstatic and beside myself with joy. We were getting a Steinway in perfect 
      condition! It took three years, but it was worth it.</p>

    <p>And then it got even better.</p>

    <p>The next issue was the timing. Steve didn’t know when the move would happen. So 
      we put things on hold. He said he’d call me and let me know when I’d have to pick 
      it up. When that call came in I’d have to be ready &ndash; so I called the movers.</p>

    <p>In this same time frame we planned to put down a new floor at The Buttonwood Tree. 
      We had received a grant and planned the job to be done in late October. Our space 
      has a lovely performance room that doubles as an art gallery about 20’ x 20’, and 
      the other room is a small bookstore. To redo the floor we’d have to move everything 
      from one room to the other, and of course the piano had to be disassembled.</p>

    <p>I talked to a local moving company about a moving our old piano. We arranged for 
      the piano to be disassembled and moved on Monday, then returned to its space after 
      the floor was done.</p>

    <p>On the Friday before the floor job was to be done, I got the call from Steve. He 
      said the piano needed to be picked up on the following Tuesday, serendipitously the 
      same week we planned to redo the floor! This meant we could pick up his piano, store 
      it for a few days, and then move it into the performance space after the floor was done.</p>

    <p>So we moved the old piano to the moving company for storage until we eventually 
      traded it away. The moving company didn’t even charge us for storing the Steinway!</p>

    <p>Only the Universe could have planned it so well.</p>

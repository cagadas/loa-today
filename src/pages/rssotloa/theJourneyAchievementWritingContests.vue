    <h5 class="h5 bottom0">The Junior Achievement Writing Contests</h5>
    <h6 class="h6">by Barbara Pinti</h6>

    <p>At the age of 15, when I knew nothing about the Law of Attraction, 
      I had an experience that made me wonder what exactly was going on.</p>

    <p>As a sophomore in high school, among my other activities, I joined 
      Junior Achievement.  There were approximately 10 J.A. companies in 
      my school, and each company had about 10-12 students in it.</p>

    <p>My company made a simple three-candle candelabra.  Our job was to 
      organize the company with a president, vice president, secretary, and 
      treasurer to manufacture and sell our product at a profit.</p>

    <p> Toward the end of that school year, it was announced that there 
      would be an essay contest about what Junior Achievement meant to us.  
      They told us that there would be one girl winner and one boy winner of 
      the contest and that all J.A. members could participate.  They would 
      fly winners to the Eastern Region Junior Achievement Conference in 
      Atlantic City.  Wow! I had never flown before, a really exciting prospect 
      for a young girl who had not traveled.</p>

    <p>My boyfriend was also a member of a Junior Achievement company.  I 
      began to picture each of us winning and going together to Atlantic City.  
      Everyone was in a tizzy about this opportunity.  Some weren’t interested 
      in writing an essay, but many of my friends were.  There was a lot of 
      competition, so I knew that I had to do my best.</p>

    <p>I started writing some notes in my journal about different things I would 
      say about my experience as a Junior Achiever and all the things it meant to 
      me. I became more and more excited about the prospect of winning the contest 
      with my boyfriend.</p>

    <p>I began daydreaming. I started visualizing what the conference would be like 
      and what the hotel would be like, not easy to do since I had never stayed in 
      a hotel or seen a conference before!  We would stay on the boardwalk in 
      Atlantic City, and that seemed incredibly exciting to me.  Going to the ocean 
      was not something I had ever done before because I lived in a city in the 
      center of a state with no seaside access.</p>

    <p>At night before I went to sleep, I imagined walking along the boardwalk with 
      my boyfriend and seeing the beautiful ocean close by.  During classes I found 
      myself thinking about the contest instead of paying attention to the teacher.   
      I went to the library and took out a book about Atlantic City.  It was a 
      well-known city and had so many interesting places to visit.  I literally 
      became an expert on the city.  Of course this was back in the late 1950s, 
      so things have changed since then.</p>

    <p>I felt strongly this dream was going to come true.  I confided in my best 
      friend that I truly believed I would win the contest and that my boyfriend 
      would as well.  She listened as she always did, but I’m not sure what she really 
      thought about what probably seemed like a pipe dream.</p>

    <p>I continued writing notes in my journal and shortly began to write a rough 
      draft of the essay.  My paper looked a mess with the many cross outs and changes 
      I kept making to the wording.</p>

    <p>After reworking it for another week, I felt it was ready to hand in to our 
      adviser.  Before handing it in, I put my hand on it and said a little prayer 
      about this paper being the winning entry.</p>

    <p>The next two weeks were the most difficult. The winners would not be announced 
      until our Friday assembly.  That gave me a lot of time to daydream and visualize 
      my boyfriend and I both winning that contest, flying on an airplane, and landing 
      in Atlantic City among all the other Junior Achievers.  My visualizations were 
      probably just as exciting as the real thing.</p>

    <p>The morning of the assembly arrived.  I wore my best skirt and sweater in 
      anticipation of being called up to the front of the auditorium and being announced 
      as the winner.  I was very nervous thinking about this.  It truly never occurred 
      to me that it would not happen the way I imagined it.</p>

    <p>As the principal spoke, my foot tapped in expectation.  He gave a talk about 
      Junior Achievement, about all its benefits, and how proud he was of all of our 
      accomplishments in learning about business.  Meanwhile everyone in the audience 
      waited impatiently for the results of the contest.</p>

    <p>The next thing I knew, I walked up to the front of the auditorium amidst much 
      clapping.  Even though I expected to win, it was still a shock when it happened.  
      I was exhilarated!  When I reached the front of the room I saw my boyfriend 
      coming up the aisle to receive his congratulations on being picked as the other 
      winner.  Oh wow, was this really happening?</p>

    <p>Yes, it was! From the moment I heard about the contest, I <em>knew</em> I would 
    be chosen as the representative from my town.  I soon realized that my strong desire 
    to win and my daydreaming about it might have been what made it all come true.</p>

    <p>I stored these thoughts in my mind and used them in later years when I wanted 
      something badly.  I thought of them as a kind of magic way to get what I wanted.  
      It wasn’t until I learned about The Law of Attraction that I fully understood it.</p>

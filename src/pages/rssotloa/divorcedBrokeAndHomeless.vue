    <h6 class="h6">by Mike McEwen</h6>

    <p>That's where I was in 2013, the result of 20 years of trying to make everyone else 
      happy but myself. I guess this is what it takes to "wake up" and be responsible for 
      your own happiness.</p>

    <p>Looking back on it today, I am very grateful for all the failures and the lessons I 
      learned, which helped me to write this story in the hope that I can inspire someone 
      who's going through something similar. When one gets caught up in life’s circumstances, 
      it's like being trapped in a revolving door of lack. The Law of Attraction gave me 
      plenty of opportunities to continue feeling all that I lacked. I eventually realized 
      that the one thing I lacked most was happiness.</p>

    <p>My divorce was finalized July 28, 2013. On August 1st, I arrived in Phoenix, Arizona 
      to visit my daughter, son-in-law, and two grandkids for a healing vacation. For the 
      first time in a long time, I felt like I was moving forward, and I was so grateful to 
      be with my Arizona family. I arrived back in Connecticut in late August refreshed and 
      feeling loved and appreciated ... something I hadn't felt in a long time.</p>

    <p>I was still homeless but not broke. A good friend of mine invited me to stay at his 
      house until I could get my own apartment. John likes big bonfires, and I arrived one 
      Friday evening to find him building one.</p>

    <p>It gave us a great opportunity to sit around the fire and drink some beer, so we did. 
      Around the fourth beer, I decided to burn all of the old negative past paperwork and 
      anything linked to my unhappiness. I made the intention to connect with new people with 
      similar interests.</p>

    <p>Oh what a great night that was! I had no idea what was about to happen.</p>

    <p>Sitting at the kitchen table the next morning having coffee, I decided to go online 
      to check out some events. I found a meditation group meeting that afternoon in the 
      town where I grew up and decided to attend. After the meeting, I talked with the 
      facilitator of the meditation group, telling her that I would like to find more 
      events to attend so I could meet more positive, like-minded people, and she recommended 
      I check out a website called Meetup.com.</p>

    <p>Back at my friend’s house that afternoon, I decided to go online to check out the 
      Meetup.com site. I typed in “local events.” The first thing that popped up was Laughter 
      Yoga at The Buttonwood Tree. So without hesitation I signed up for it. Not only did 
      Laughter Yoga teach me how to laugh at things that would normally upset me, I met 
      the director of The Buttonwood Tree, Anne-Marie, and it didn't take long before a 
      strong connection grew between us ... something that hadn't happened in a long time. 
      She asked me out for tea.</p>

    <p>I replied, "It's 9:00 at night. How about a beer?"</p>
    <p>In conversation over a few beers we found that we had a lot in common, so I invited 
      her to sunrise Tai Chi that next morning. I was happy that she showed up. After Tai 
      Chi we went out for breakfast. It was a wonderful start to a new relationship.</p>

    <p>Before I knew it, we had a dinner date. The food and the conversation were great as 
      we sat overlooking Lake Pocotopaug at Angelico's Lake House Restaurant.</p>

    <p>What a great manifestation!</p>

    <p>Several days after our dinner date she handed me a key to her apartment. Hesitating 
      at first, I realized here was another manifestation: no longer homeless and no longer 
      alone. As we say in Laughter Yoga, "Very Good Very Good Yay!"</p>

    <p>After living with her for about a year, the landlord sold the house, and we had to 
      move out … in three weeks! Oh no! At that time, my contracting business was slow, and 
      money was real tight. How could we find a place to live in three weeks?</p>

    <p>Intend it to be and it shall be. My then fiancée just kept saying,  "No worries … the 
      right place to move into will show up at the right time.”</p>

    <p>Okay, I thought, but where's the money going to come from? If we feel abundant when 
      there seems like there's nothing to feel abundant about, the universal Law of Attraction 
      matches the feeling with more of the same. People, circumstances, and events line up at 
      the right time … and that's what happened.</p>

    <p>Anne-Marie called a Realtor whom she worked with in the past and received a lead on a 
      single-family house for lease that she <em>thought</em> might be available but wasn’t 
      sure. Anne-Marie investigated and found that it was the perfect little house for us.</p>

    <p>We had five days to sign the lease, but we didn't have the $3,000 we needed up front 
      for it.</p>

    <p>I had sold a contracting job that would yield us enough money, but it would take 30 days 
      to complete the job and get paid. Three days before signing the lease, I received a call 
      from the management company for the construction project. The bank had taken over their 
      property, creating a very unusual situation because they had to close out all the 
      accounts for that property. He requested that I send my invoice for the job even though 
      I hadn’t started so he could pay me in full to get it off the books for the sum total 
      of $9,600!</p>

    <p>Problem solved. I still can’t believe it</p>

    <h6 class="h6">by David Scott Bartky</h6>

    <p>Several years ago, I decided I wanted to move after visiting a home with 
      gorgeous views on a very quiet street.</p>

    <p>Although my house was very nice inside, I didn’t realize until after purchasing 
      it that you could hear all the noise from the busy street corner on which it sat. 
      I could hear every car, bus, or truck that drove by. There was no view except of 
      the street or the neighbor’s house. So between no nice view, and lots of street 
      noise, it was time to move!</p>

    <p>Besides a nice view and a very quiet street, I wanted a single story home, one 
      with an attached garage. The idea of not having to deal with stairs sounded really 
      good to me – not that I can’t walk up and down stairs, but my parents were getting 
      older, and I had a dog who can’t climb stairs, so a single story home would be much 
      easier.</p>

    <p>After meeting with a Realtor, I was not surprised to be told that single story 
      homes are very hard to find. Her negativity didn’t concern me in the least. I know 
      that the Universe knows what I want and will make it happen.</p>

    <p>She did have one good idea: to sell my current home before finding my next home. 
      That way there would be no chance of paying two mortgage payments at once, and I’d 
      have the down payment for the new home.</p>

    <p>As anyone who knows about selling homes can tell you, the best time to put a house 
      on the market is in the Spring. However, it was December, and we wanted to be in a 
      new home by the Summer. So we didn’t want to wait until Springtime to list the house.</p>

    <p>Two weeks after we met with the Realtor, a For Sale sign appeared in front of our 
      house, and the open house occurred two days later on Sunday. We were unsure what price 
      to put our home because home prices in the area were all over the place. Our Realtor 
      suggested we price low to start a potential bidding war, which is what we did. There’s 
      no guarantee of a bidding war, but it’s a risk we were willing to take.</p>

    <p>The day after the open house, the Realtor called and told us we had two offers. She 
      said that one offer was good, but the other offer would have us “dancing on the tables!” 
       course I was most interested in the dancing on the tables offer, since the more we got 
       for this house meant the more we would have for the purchase of the next house.</p>

    <p>We met with the Realtor, who told us we had a full price offer. Then she told us the 
      other offer was WAY higher than the first one. It turns out the couple who made that 
      offer had tried to buy a few other homes but were outbid. So this time around they 
      came in with their best and final offer.</p>

    <p>Our Realtor cautioned us not to get too excited about such a high offer because the 
      house had to appraise at that amount in order for the deal to go through. I honestly 
      had no doubt that the house would appraise at the full amount, even though others 
      involved did have doubts. The Universe knew that we needed that extra money, and I 
      knew it would all work out.</p>

    <p>Needless to say, the home did appraise at that amount, and the buyer also wanted a 
      quick closing, which is another thing we really wanted. A month later, we sat at the 
      closing table, where they handed us a very large check! Thank you Law of Attraction!</p>

    <p>Now we needed to find a new house to buy that met our requirements. We must have 
      looked at 50-60 homes. Some our Realtor found for us, and some she didn’t.</p>

    <p>One day I drove by a home in our preferred area and saw a <em>For Sale By Owner</em> 
    sign on the lawn. I quickly went home to my computer and plugged in the address. The 
    home was very nice and had 90% of what we were looking for. It was on a very quiet 
    street, was basically a single story home – only had two steps up to the 2nd floor &mdash; 
    and had a great back yard.</p>

    <p>The only issue was that it was way above our price range. Even our Realtor, who didn’t 
      find the home for us, told us not to look at it because of the price. However, knowing 
      how the Law of Attraction works, I decided not to let that get in our way.</p>

    <p>The day before we found it, the owner decided to list it with a Realtor because he 
      wasn’t getting any action trying to sell it himself. We went to look at the house, 
      and once inside we knew it was the one. The owner liked us and told us to come back 
      again to look at it if we wanted to. So we took him up on his offer and went back a 
      few more times.</p>

    <p>Soon the seller’s Realtor called me and asked if we were going to make an offer on 
      the home. We said we wanted to but it was out of our price range. He then told us a 
      long story about how the owner listed the house at a price that was way too high. 
      That’s the reason he didn’t get a lot of people coming to look at it. The Realtor 
      also told us that the owner had to move by a certain date because of plans he had 
      made, so that we should basically make an offer because he had to sell.</p>

    <p>We decided on an offer two days later. When I called, the Realtor told me that the 
      day before someone else made an all-cash offer, and the owner accepted! How could 
      this be? I just knew this was my house! I decided to stay positive about it and 
      didn’t get upset because I trusted it would work out.</p>

    <p>My parents saw the house with us a few times, and they clicked with the owner. After 
      my mom heard that he accepted another offer, she called him and demanded, “How could 
      you do that?” He told her that we were his first choice, but he didn’t know we were 
      going to make an offer when he accepted the other offer. He also told her that he would 
      try to get out of selling the home to the buyer. My mom told me what he said, but I 
      didn’t believe it. Why would he let an all-cash offer go?</p>

    <p>A few weeks went by, and I started looking at other homes on the Internet. One day, 
      I received a text message from the seller’s Realtor asking, “Are you still interested 
      in that house?”</p>

    <p>I replied, “Yes! Why?”</p>

    <p>The deal fell through with the other buyer. The owner refused to fix anything on their list! 
      The buyer pulled out because they didn’t want to spend the money to fix everything.</p>

    <p>The Seller kept his promise to my mother and got out of the deal! How crazy is that! 
      He accepted our offer, telling us to wait before we ordered the home inspection so he 
      could fix everything that had to be fixed. How often does that happen?</p>

    <p>When he finished (including installing a brand new heating system), we got the house 
      inspected. It passed with flying colors.</p>

    <p>A few months later we moved in, and it has been a wonderful, quiet home with great views 
      out of every window and with only two stair steps. Thank you Law of Attraction!</p>

    <h5 class="h5 bottom0">The Third Degree</h5>
    <h6 class="h6">by Linda Armstrong</h6>

    <p>I was a first degree black belt in karate. It was suggested to Gavin (my husband 
      and Sensei) that I be put up for the upcoming promotion test by the USA World Chief 
      Instructors. Gavin, who has his sixth degree belt, had not yet considered putting 
      me up for promotion to second degree. In our style of karate, when you go for 
      promotion (grading) in the black belt grades you test before the four World Chief 
      Instructors of Kimura Shukokai Karate, held at the World Chief Instructors course 
      attended by hundreds of people from all around the globe.</p>

    <p>I had three months to prepare. Others going for black belt grading had already been 
      told to prepare for the test many months prior. Gavin told me that if I worked hard 
      enough, and if he thought I was ready, he would let me go for testing. Gavin does 
      not give out gradings easily. He expects a lot from his students and does not want 
      to put someone up for grading unless they meet his standards … especially me, his 
      wife. Well, I took this as a challenge. In my mind I thought … <em>Oh yeah, I’ll 
      show you I’m ready!</em></p>

    <p>So I started training harder. I went to more classes. I practiced my katas (which 
      are like a choreographed fight, only without any opponents). I worked on my impact 
      and worked on fighting. <em>But, this is not where the real work was done.</em> You 
      see, I practiced in my mind. I did my best training inside my head.</p>

    <p>It’s sort of like meditation, only I did this all the time, anywhere I was. I could 
      be riding in a car, taking a shower, sitting at the Motor Vehicle station waiting to 
      renew my license. It didn’t matter where I was. I imagined in my mind. I did my katas 
      in my mind and often actually worked up a sweat. I would spar (fight) in my mind, and 
      my heart would beat rapidly. I felt the adrenaline. I felt all of the emotions attached 
      to showing these four Chief Instructors that not only was I second degree, <em>I was 
      actually <strong>third degree!</strong></em></p>

    <p>Yes, I was going for second degree grading, but I told myself, <em>I am a third degree 
      black belt.</em> I would have no trouble getting my second degree. They would observe 
      me at the test and pass me with flying colors. I imagined what being a third degree 
      might be like (even though I didn’t really know).</p>

    <p>“Anything that you have the ability to visualize you have the ability to have a physical 
      manifestation of!” &mdash; Abraham-Hicks</p>

    <p>The test is given after two days of intense training, with one hour instruction by 
      each of the four Chief Instructors both days. The facility accommodated 300 to 400 
      participants on very hard, carpeted floors. Usually when training we work on thick 
      padded floors.</p>

    <p>Prior to these two days we had had another two days of training, again four hours each 
      day. Needless to say, by the time the testing took place my feet and legs (along with 
      everyone else’s) were feeling some pain.</p>

    <p>The Chief Instructors ran us all through our punches, kicks, blocks, and combinations, 
      both in the air and with the impact pads. Then we did a variety of katas. We did whatever 
      we were asked to do during this test despite feeling extremely tired.</p>

    <p>Then the test was over. There were close to 30 students testing. All of the 
      participants in the test stood still as the Chief Instructors deliberated. In karate, 
      when standing still we stand in Yoi position. This is ready position, basically 
      standing still but ready to move if needed. You dare not fidget or lose focus. You 
      stand ready.</p>

    <p>Well, I have to tell you, standing still while they deliberated was the absolute 
      hardest part of the whole week. My legs were killing me! I could see other students 
      struggling like me with the simple act of standing still. Everyone’s legs shook.</p>

    <p>The Chief Instructors spoke to each other for what felt like hours. It was probably 
      only 20 minutes, but it felt like an eternity. Finally, they asked each student to go 
      up and stand before them as they awarded their new gradings. I’m happy to say that I 
      passed the test and received my second degree black belt.</p>

    <p>Shortly after the test was over, each of the four instructors came to me individually 
      and told me that they had been deliberating for such a long time because they wanted to 
      jump me to third degree! Whooooo hooooo!  Thank you Law of Attraction!</p>

    <p>They never jump black belt degrees and didn’t want to start a precedent.  This just 
      was not done in the black belt grades. Instead, they asked me to test again the 
      following year for third degree, which was an honor because normally going for third 
      degree requires a minimum of another three years of training. It normally takes as 
      long as it takes until you show your Sensei you are ready.</p>
    
    <p>I did return the following year to test again and was awarded my third degree black 
      belt in karate.</p>

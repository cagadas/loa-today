    <h5 class="h5 bottom0">Our Dream Home</h5>
    <h6 class="h6">by Linda Armstrong</h6>

    <p>The funny thing about how we manifested our dream home is that I was really FINALLY 
      happy in the home we were living in. I did not plan to move. We lived in a very small 
      Cape Cod style home on a very small lot, about one-eighth of an acre.</p>

    <p>When we purchased that house, we actually had to settle for it. It was the only house 
      we could afford in the town where we really wanted to live. We wanted to live there 
      because the town had a very good school system.</p>

    <p>The house was filthy because of the hoarders who occupied it. So there was a lot to 
      confront. I actually had a knot in my stomach when we made the offer. I was horrified 
      at the thought of living there</p>

      at the thought of living there</p>

    <p>I am very interested in Feng Shui, so I had a Feng Shui Master come to the house and 
      do a floor plan for us to make the energy in this house work best for us. Well, after 
      she did a walk through and took some notes, she told us that she saw red ... blood ... 
      and that it would be best if we were to move. Since we could not move, we had her 
      create a Feng Shui plan designed just for us to make the energy work better.</p>

    <p>We rearranged furniture and placed crystals in specific places throughout the house. 
      She told us that we would have to move our front entrance. She said it had to be moved 
      to another side of the house.</p>

    <p>Cape Cod homes generally have a staircase that leads straight out the front door. In 
      this house the entrance had literally three feet between the door and the staircase, 
      just enough space for the door to open. The staircase led straight upstairs into the 
      bathroom … more bad energy. The more she looked around the house, the more bad energy 
      flow she saw.</p>

    <p>We did move the entrance, adding a new foyer. We purchased a really cool carved wood 
      door that had a large sun and moons carved into it. It was such a happy door. I actually 
      miss that door. It set the mood for the whole house.</p>

    <p>I created a custom mosaic floor in the foyer, making it very inviting and improving 
      the house’s energy. We removed walls and opened up the stairway so that it had a wall 
      on only one side. We added a nice iron bed foot board as a see-through railing for the 
      basement. It was quite unique. It really did turn out to be a great little house full 
      of character.</p>

    <p>Always in the back of my mind, I thought that once we renovated the kitchen, we would 
      be able to sell the house and move to a home that we really wanted. We added all new 
      cabinets, granite counter tops, a tiled floor, and a really interesting stone mosaic 
      back splash that pulled out an amethyst color that ran subtly through the granite 
      counter top, which was mostly black with shades of grey. We added all new stainless 
      steel appliances, making the kitchen a wonderful space.</p>

    <p>After seven years of work, we were very happy with the house. We loved this little 
      house that was as different as night from day compared to when we moved into it. 
      I landscaped the whole property myself. I enjoyed doing that as well.</p>

    <p>There was no garage. When we created the new front entrance, we added a large pergola 
      that acted as a carport. We really put a lot of ourselves into that house, adding so 
      much LOVE to it.</p>

    <p>While sitting in my living room with my sister-in-law, she asked me if, now that the 
      house was totally renovated, would we consider moving? She knew I hadn’t been happy 
      when buying it, but she admired the work we had done. Would we want to sell it and 
      move on or stay and love it since it was a really cute and unique home?</p>

    <p>My answer to her was, “The only way we would move is if we found a ranch style home 
      that was contemporary in design. And it would have to be on a large piece of property.”</p>

    <p>And that was that. I didn’t give it another thought. I merely stated what our ultimate 
      dream home would be.</p>

    <p>Then my son, Steele, who always hated school since preschool, asked if he could drop 
      out of school and get his GED. He was miserable in school. We had done Child Study 
      Team each year, but not one of the so-called professionals could ever figure him out. 
      You see, he is very smart. He never fell into any category that would place him with 
      any sort of learning disability. He is a very respectful kid, never got into trouble. 
      But he just hated being in school all day, every day.</p>

    <p>He had a way of outsmarting his teachers, in a respectful way. He would only do the 
      bare minimum of any requirement he was asked to do. The teachers wanted more.</p>

    <p>I had to tell his teachers to be specific when giving him an assignment. If they asked 
      him to summarize a book he read, he would turn in one paragraph that told in a nutshell 
      what the book was about. He had an algebra tutor. Before the tutor could write out the 
      math, he would already have the answer.</p>

    <p>Kids actually do know what is in their best interest. Steele had long used Law of 
      Attraction. He made things go his way without any resistance.</p>

    <p>At first my husband and I were not too thrilled about him wanting to leave school, 
      but Steele was so sure of himself that we decided he knew best.</p>

    <p>Since Steele was leaving school, there was no reason to stay in the town we lived in any 
      longer. Now that there wasn’t anything keeping us there, we decided to look around for 
      another house to live in. Our current house was very nice now, and it would be easy to 
      sell.</p>

    <p>We started looking around and found a nice house on an acre of land. It met most of our 
      requirements except that it was a split level. We put our house on the market. It sold 
      for full asking price, and we then put a bid on this new house, which was accepted.</p>

    <p>Everything was good … until our buyer backed out. Now we had to try to find a new buyer. 
      The house was on the market again, and although everyone seemed to like the house and 
      made nice comments about it, we weren’t getting another offer. And then the seller of 
      the house who had accepted our offer lost patience with us and decided to accept another 
      offer. We lost that house.</p>

    <p>We did then get another offer on our house from a new buyer. This offer was $20,000 less 
      than our asking price, but they were very serious about purchasing it. My husband was in 
      the hospital having hip resurfacing/replacement surgery. As I sat with him in the hospital 
      room, I thought that I might as well start looking for homes in our slightly reduced price 
      range.</p>

    <p>I found a very contemporary-looking ranch on nearly two acres of land. I remembered the 
      conversation with my sister-in-law about my dream home. It seemed perfect.</p>

    <p>We couldn’t wait to go and see it.</p>

    <p>I went to see the house first. A few days later, Gavin could hop around using crutches, so 
      we both went to see the house. We loved it.</p>

    <p>This was the house that we wanted. We made an offer and it was accepted.</p>

    <p>Next came the legal details of purchasing a home. Gavin’s brother and his girlfriend came 
      to visit us from California. They stayed with us for a week. During their stay, they 
      started talking about the Law of Attraction. We had never heard of it before. We were 
      very intrigued. They spoke to us about Abraham-Hicks, and once they were back in 
      California, Gavin’s brother sent us a video clip of the Abraham material. Soon, we were 
      hooked!</p>

    <p>We always thought that everything happens for a reason … that was for sure with us. And 
      always in both of our lives, things always did work out. But, now for the first time we 
      fully realized that we do create our own reality and that the Universe will guide us to 
      our desires as long as we are in alignment with the energy of the desire.</p>

    <p>While we were in attorney review, someone else put in a higher offer on the house that 
      we were in the process of purchasing. While the sellers considered that offer, the buyers 
      of our old house were having some difficulties with their Realtor and their mortgage 
      commitment. It was turning into a real struggle, and at times it didn’t look good, but 
      thankfully we had learned about the power of our thoughts.</p>

    <p>So I started showing appreciation for my current home (I actually miss it even now). 
      I also thought about why I wanted this new house and why I thought I would receive it. 
      I created stories in my mind of living in the new house. I really did A LOT of 
      visualization.</p>

    <p> looked at the listing photos, decorating each room in my mind and creating experiences 
      of living in the new house. I saw us hanging out in the backyard entertaining guests. 
      I sat with these images in the listing and imagined living in the house before we even 
      had the keys. I did this every day.</p>

    <p>I took on the feeling of what it would be like already living there. I did NOT let 
      myself think about it not happening for us, I only thought about how great it will be 
      when we moved in.  I really felt into it. That’s the power of imagination: anything is 
      possible.</p>

    <p>I swam in the energy of living in that home so much that the owners decided to sell it 
      to us and our buyers were able to complete their purchase of our old home. WOW!</p>

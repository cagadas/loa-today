    <h5 class="h5 bottom0">The Poker Tournament</h5>
    <h6 class="h6">by Walt Thiessen</h6>

    <p>Here's a very simple manifestation story that happened on March 10, 2018. I play 
      poker online … play chips, although I used to win money before the U.S. Government 
      shut that down. I'm pretty good at it. I've accumulated over 90 million play chips 
      in my account over the years while playing sporadically and casually.</p>

    <p>This particular Saturday I played in a tournament, my favorite way to play. It was 
      a pretty big tournament, over 700 players. I decided to use it as a sandbox, so to 
      speak, for practicing LOA.</p>

    <p>In the past, when I tried deliberately creating while playing poker, I usually tried 
      manifesting particular hands at particular times. However, like everyone else, I have 
      my own levels of resistance, and I usually ended up failing to manifest the right hand 
      at the right time.</p>

    <p>This time, I did it differently. I decided to stop trying to micromanage the hands 
      and just leave it to the Universe to provide the ideal results in its own way and time.</p>

    <p>So instead of trying to attract winning hands, I visualized doubling my chips and/or 
      reaching new and higher chip levels.</p>

    <p>Before I started doing this, I'd already lost half my chip pile. I was way behind and 
      in danger of losing all my chips and being eliminated from the tournament. So I figured, 
      <em>This is a good time to really put my new LOA approach to the test.</em></p>

    <p>I had about 700 chips at that point. (All contestants started the tournament with 
      1,500 chips). So I decided I wanted the Universe to double my chip count and got 
      really excited about it. A few hands later, it happened.</p>

    <p>So I decided to do it again. This time I wanted 3,000 chips. Once again, I just kept 
      thinking about having 3,000 chips, building my emotional excitement about it while 
      playing the hands. A few hands later, I reached that goal as well.</p>

    <p>As the tournament went on, I kept asking for a higher chip count than what I had 
      already achieved. I got myself into a really great feeling place each time.</p>

    <p>I didn't worry about my fortunes from one hand to the next. Sometimes I won, and 
      sometimes I lost.</p>

    <p>Overall, out of 125 hands played, I won about one out of every five hands I played, 
      while managing to avoid having any big losses.  It didn't matter to me what the results 
      were. As long as I was still in the tournament and successfully focusing on my goal, 
      without getting attached to any particular hand, I was happy.</p>

    <p>Nor did I worry about how it would happen. I only focused on the goal. I didn't care 
      which particular hand got me there, regardless of what cards I had, good or bad.</p>

    <p>At one point, my goal was to get 20,000 chips. I had about 9,000 at the time. I got a 
      really big hand, but only won about 3,000 chips with it.</p>

    <p>I thought, <em>Oh well.</em></p>

    <p>But I'd forgotten that I was also in a tournament where you get bonuses for 
      eliminating another player. I did just that with this particular hand, and my 
      reward was – you guessed it – 20,000 chips!</p>

    <p>This kept going and going. Over time I got to 30,000 – then 50,000 – then 80,000 – 
      then 100,000  - then 150,000 - then 200,000 chips.</p>

    <p>Each step of the way, I visualized my goal, got really excited about it, and held 
      it in my mind as I played each hand, not allowing myself to become attached to the 
      result of any particular hand. Without exception, I kept reaching my goals!</p>

    <p>When I reached 500,000 chips, I was the leader in the tournament. I also got greedy. 
      I tried to micromanage, scaring players into folding with big bets and "captaining" 
      the table as it's called.</p>

    <p>The result? I lost more than half my chips!</p>

    <p><em>Okay,</em> I thought. <em>I get the message. No more micromanaging! No more 
      trying to make it happen.</em></p>

    <p>I went right back to focusing on my next chip goal and getting really excited about 
      how I would feel when I got there.</p>

    <p>Much faster than I expected, I got back to 500,000 chips after about 10 more hands.</p>

    <p>When I got to 600,000, there were just two players left, me and the guy I'd been 
      butting heads with for some time.</p>

    <p>I got a King – Nine pocket, off-suit.</p>

    <p>I didn't know it, but he had a Queen – Seven pocket, off-suit.</p>

    <p>A “pocket” is the two cards each player gets dealt face down in the No Limit Texas 
      Holdem style of poker.</p>

    <p>“Off-suit” means that the two cards are from different suits.</p>

    <p>Neither hand was a strong hand, but both were worth betting.</p>

    <p>I raised, he called, and then the first three cards flopped: King – King – Seven. 
      I had three of a kind … three Kings! That's a very rare kind of flop, and I got it 
      at the best time.</p>

    <p>My opponent had two Sevens, and since the odds are about 4:1 against matching 
      anything in your hand on any given play, and since he saw two Kings on the board 
      (which made it even less likely in his mind that I would have a King), he figured 
      the odds favored him.</p>

    <p>So he went <em>all in</em> with his remaining chips. I called, and I won the pot, 
    all his chips, and thereby won the tournament!</p>

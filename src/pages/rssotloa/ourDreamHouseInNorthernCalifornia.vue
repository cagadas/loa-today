    <h5 class="h5 bottom0">Our Dream House in Northern California</h5>
    <h6 class="h6">by Janet Warnecke</h6>

    <p>In 2015, My husband, Ed and I, after years of living literally in the middle of Hollywood, 
      California, started putting into action our plan of moving to Auburn, California and away 
      from the traffic and the crazies.  We needed to sell our home and improve our credit scores 
      and get all our financial ducks in a row.  We knew we had a slightly long road ahead, but 
      it was certainly doable, and we started doing just that.</p>
      
    <p>That summer, our daughter graduated from the University of California at Santa Barbara but 
      was still living at home and looking to find her way.  What exactly does a degree in German 
      get you? She switched from majoring in history to German because “The German Department is 
      more fun.” Sounded good to us &ndash; fun is better.  Without knowing it, she clearly had her own 
      momentum, but that’s a whole different story.  She is currently working on her Masters degree.  
      So proud!</p>

    <p>We moved to Encino as a pit stop for her to find a job and begin working.  We were not 
      exactly in a position for Ed to give up his job (we were still improving our financial 
      situation). All that time, we constantly discussed what we wanted from the move, i.e., 
      the feeling, the calm, the lack of rush hour traffic, the ability to work from home, 
      neighbors we would actually get to know as opposed to the zillion people surrounding us 
      in condos and apartments.</p>

    <p>We rented a home from a friend in 2015 in Encino.  We moved in and all was going great.  
      Our daughter started working and boom, within a year she met and started a relationship 
      with a very nice guy.  His family was very welcoming and later that year she moved in with 
      him and his family &ndash; all the while continuing to enjoy her job and look into her options.</p>

    <p>Things seemed to be lining up perfectly for my husband and I to make the move to Auburn 
      as we were only planning on staying in Encino for a year and a half.</p>

    <p>In October 2016, my husband was diagnosed with throat cancer, and our whole world changed. 
      Three months of heavy chemo was followed by a short break before handling 37 daily treatments 
      of radiation.  We were devastated.  With Ed in a fight for his life, moving was no longer on 
      the front burner.</p>

    <p>The treatments were brutal.  I was his sole caretaker and had no idea what I was doing.  
      It was truly one minute at a time, one appointment at a time, one pill at a time.  Without 
      going into too much detail, I had never experienced anything so scary.  My husband went 
      from 160 lbs to 112 lbs in three months.  I have no idea how he didn’t fling himself off 
      the roof, except that he was too weak to climb up a ladder.</p>

    <p>With the help of friends and family we made it through.  He had a very good result from 
      the chemo which gave us strength to go forward with the radiation.</p>

    <p>During this time I did not personally think about the house and the move, but my husband 
      told me later that it was constantly on his mind to get through this treatment, so that 
      one way or another we could make it to our dream life.  During most of his treatment he 
      could barely speak, so he did not share this vision with me, but thank God the Universe 
      was listening and that we had been filling that vortex over a lifetime.</p>

    <p>By July 2017. the day after my husband’s radiation treatments ended, our landlords 
      (previously our friends of 30 years) gave us a 30% rent increase.  It was astronomical!  
      Apparently, they wanted to sell the home but had not informed us.  So with this giant 
      increase we decided to move as quickly as possible.  Ed was way too weak to move, but 
      we started taking action to find storage facilities and do whatever we could to go 
      forward.  More importantly, we had gotten the news that the tumors were all gone, and 
      Ed was given a clean bill of health, but it would still take several years to recover 
      fully.</p>

    <p>Our hopes were high that we would still be able to make our dream come true.  Unbeknownst 
      to me &ndash; and certainly to Ed, because we were so consumed with treatment and appointments 
      and ER visits &ndash; we didn’t pay attention as well as we should have to our financial 
      situation. When we went to apply for a loan, we were told it would take us approximately 
      a year or so to clean things up &ndash; again &ndash; to get a loan.</p>

    <p>That was it for me.  I cracked.  After getting through the cancer and seeing the light 
      at the end of the tunnel, I was DEVASTATED!  Another year?</p>

    <p>After I sobbed for about three hours that my life was over &ndash; not too self-obsessed or 
      ungrateful for the good things happening, i.e., cancer free &ndash; I got a grip and pulled 
      myself together.  Well, it would take what it takes.  We’re not giving up.  I made a 
      list of what I wanted in a house and started thinking about it again.</p>

    <p>By November we were ready to move, after briefly talking about our “house dreams” with 
      the guys on the LOA Today podcast.  Even with Ed’s low weight and difficult physical 
      condition, we packed and the movers came.  We were out by November 30th, on our way to 
      stay with my father-in-law up north and darn grateful that we had a nice place to stay 
      for Ed to continue to recover and for us to house hunt.</p>

    <p>In December, we saw several homes that first week, but we didn’t have much positive 
      vibration on the actual purchase of a house because we knew we had to improve the 
      financial end.</p>

    <p>But just being up here, looking at the lake, looking at the trees, the beauty &ndash;
       our vibrations improved whether we had our own house or not.  If it took a year, fine, 
       we were in the most beautiful place on earth for us.  A lot of stress released as we 
       accepted the situation and just enjoyed our surroundings.</p>

    <p>We suddenly got word that Ed qualified for a VA loan, which opened up a whole new 
      enthusiasm about purchasing a house.  The day after that news, our lender said, “Hmm, 
      your credit score is great, I don’t know what happened.  You can get any loan you need.”  
      We were so jazzed.  Now we just had to find a house.  No pressure though, we thought 
      we’d take the next three or four months to look around.</p>

    <p>On New Year’s Day 2018, we took a walk. It was a gorgeous day.  We decided to go up a 
      street we never take, and there on the corner was a house for sale.  Since it was New 
      Year’s Day we did not expect anyone to be showing the house.</p>

    <p>I had seen this particular house on the MLS listings a month earlier, and it had just
       been sold and was in escrow.  A week before, the previous potential buyer’s offer fell 
       through.</p>

    <p>The agent just happened to be in the house for a private showing as we walked by. We 
      asked if we could take a peek.  She said, “Sure.”  And we fell in love!  We made an offer, 
      and after one day of back and forth, it was accepted.</p>

    <p>What happened next was also crazy.  It seemed at every step exactly what we needed fell 
      into our lap.  All the paperwork, people who had what we needed – everything! By 
      February 8, 2018, the keys were in our hands!</p>

    <p>After moving in, about every other day I’d say to Ed things like, “You know, I didn’t 
      notice this when we were looking at the house, but I remembered I always wanted a stream 
      in the backyard – and wow, we have one!”  It was that way with so many things in this 
      house.  So much of my wish list is here.  The Christmas trees out front, the fireplace, 
      the deer and bunnies running around, the lake, the sound of children playing in the 
      neighborhood, my sliding glass doors, French doors, a guest room, a music room, etc.  
      My neighbors brought us welcome cookies.</p>

    <p class="signature">Here’s the original wish list:</p>

    <ol>
        <li class="li">Fireplace In Every Room – <strong><em>Got one in the living room</em></strong></li>
        <li class="li">3 Bedrooms, Office Space, Guest Room – <strong><em>Got it</em></strong></li>
        <li class="li">At Least 1800 Sq Ft – Would Have Accepted Less – <strong><em>Got it</em></strong></li>
        <li class="li">Trees – Amazing Views – <strong><em>Got it</em></strong></li>
        <li class="li">Close To My Father-In-Law – <strong><em>Got it (three minute walk)</em></strong></li>
        <li class="li">Short Walk To The Lake  – <strong><em>Got it</em></strong></li>
        <li class="li">Porch/Deck  – <strong><em>Got it</em></strong></li>
        <li class="li">Backyard The Deer Can’t Get Into For The Cats To Wander – <strong><em>Got it</em></strong></li>
        <li class="li">Good Closet Space – <strong><em>Got GREAT closet space</em></strong></li>
        <li class="li">Two To Three Bathrooms – <strong><em>Got three</em></strong></li>
        <li class="li">Mother-In-Law Suite – Saw several in the MLS and thought it would be a great thing 
          to have. There are not that many homes here with that situation, but i still wished for 
          it – did not expect it in a million years. – <strong><em>Got three</em></strong></li>
        <li class="li">Deer And Bunnies And Blue Birds – <strong><em>Got them</em></strong></li>
        <li class="li">Super Cozy Feeling – <strong><em>Got it</em></strong></li>
        <li class="li">Good Size Kitchen – <strong><em>Got it, nice and bright too!</em></strong></li>
        <li class="li">White Kitchen – <strong><em>Got it</em></strong></li>
        <li class="li">Decent Size Parcel Of Land – <strong><em>Got it, one-half acre</em></strong></li>
        <li class="li">Double Front Door – <strong><em>Got it, couldn’t believe it</em></strong></li>
        <li class="li">Sliding Glass Doors/French Doors – <strong><em>Got French doors in the bedroom</em></strong></li>
        <li class="li">Great Back Yard – <strong><em>Got it</em></strong></li>
        <li class="li">Garage with space/shelves and could actually fit the car – <strong><em>Got it</em></strong></li>
        <li class="li">Indoor Laundry – Last one was outside – hated that – <strong><em>Got a whole laundry 
          room with counters and sink. Amazing!</em></strong></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Plus, there were more things we didn’t even think of for our wish list that showed up 
      anyway, like a built-in sprinkler system and a golf cart.</p>

    <p>This DOES NOT HAPPEN in the middle of Hollywood! Apparently, all the years of putting 
      different thoughts on what we wanted our home and lives to look like were all piling up 
      in the vortex.  I like to think that while Ed was going through this time, OUR home was 
      being prepared to be put on the market.</p>

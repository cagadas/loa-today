    <h5 class="h5 bottom0">The Bath That Keeps On Gifting</h5>
    <h6 class="h6">by Keisha Clark</h6>

    <p>I have my own birthday tradition of taking the day for myself to do whatever 
      I want, creating it spontaneously with no particular plan or schedule.  And so 
      I did with this particular forty-somethingth birthday, letting the day unfold 
      as I enjoyed my hermitage.</p>

    <p>I let myself sleep in.  I spent extra snuggle time with my fur-babies.  I 
      received “happy birthday” calls and messages from friends.  I treated myself 
      to a nice lunch and a big screen movie.  I was having a delightful day.</p>

    <p>I began to notice my body was asking for some attention. I got the idea of a 
      hot bath for my birthday.  It was my birthday after all; the day of the forty-
      somethingth anniversary of me and my body being together (the longest relationship 
      I’ve had in this lifetime).  Wouldn’t it be perfectly fitting to give my body 
      what she desired?</p>

    <p>In the year leading up to this birthday, I had come to see my body as an equal 
      partner in this venture, though I had not always treated her that way.  She has 
      been with me through every adventure and had not kicked me out yet, and I was 
      not always very good at acknowledging, much less thanking her.</p>

    <p>On this particular birthday, I had a different idea of what my birthdays were 
      really about – celebrating my relationship with my body.  And so I chose to 
      include my body in the celebration.  She desired a bath, and I desired to co-create 
      that with her, because truly, I love baths ... I LOVE baths.</p>

    <p>For me, there is something so sensual and soul-healing being immersed in a bath 
      of steaming hot water. It is like a sacred ritual.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>I begin disconnecting from the noise of the world as I set out tea candles in 
      beautiful colored glass holders, lighting each candle and watching the flame 
      catch and glow.  I pick fresh towels from the cabinet and lay out the big 
      cotton bath mat.</p>

    <p>I begin filling the tub with hot water, dripping essential oils into the bath, 
      taking in their scent on the rising steam as each drop disappears into the water. 
      Shedding my burdens as my clothes fall to the floor, I dip my foot into the hot 
      water and allow my body to acclimate to the heat, letting the rest of me relax 
      into the bath, enveloped by it.</p>

    <p>I suspend myself in the delicious steam, wet, and white noise of the water.  
      I turn the faucet off and soak in the silence.  I breathe in the aromatic steam 
      and let it soothe me into the beyond-cognitive space of me.  I exhale and let my 
      body become liquid as the water alters the effect of gravity.  I am peaceful and 
      present in a perfect moment.  I am in communion with the Universe, receiving from 
      and offering my gratitude in a deep state of grace.</p>

    <p>I float for a while, then slowly return to my earthly awareness.  I give thanks 
      to the water as it drains from the tub.  I wrap myself in a thirsty towel and sit 
      in the afterglow, reacquainting with my body as the slightly cool air of the room 
      caresses her fresh skin.  I give thanks to her as I extinguish the candles and 
      tidy up the space, feeling refreshed, renewed, and ready to open the door to the 
      world once again.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>With this dream in mind, I found myself in a wee bit of a pickle. In order to 
      experience a hot bath, it would require a place with a bath tub and hot running 
      water, which I did not have at that time!  That would require a hotel room.  Was 
      I willing to rent a room in order to have a nice hot bath?</p>

    <p>Hmmm… At first, it was a “no,” so I looked closer. Was I willing to stretch into 
      a new choice simply because I could choose it?  My “no” quickly turned into a 
      slightly excited “yes”.</p>

    <p>“I am choosing this,” I said to myself, and the excitement began to build. 
      The moment I said “yes”, I perceived something shift in my world.  It felt like 
      the air in the room got lighter and more joyful.</p>

    <p>I asked the question, “Where do we go for this bath?” I quickly got a picture of 
      a particular hotel that was only a couple of miles from where I lived.</p>

    <p>“Really?” I asked. I was a little surprised because it was not the place I would 
      have thought to check into.  I got a definite yes-sense in response, and I chose 
      to trust it and go with it.</p>

    <p>“This should be interesting,” I thought with a laugh as I began to collect my 
      things to pack for <em>my bath getaway.</em></p>

    <p>It was a bit of fun actually, like a special something I was getting to do just 
      for me (hehehe)!  I collected my clothes and towels, bath pillow, candles, essential 
      oils, my iPad, and a few other items.  I set up my fur-babies for the evening, then 
      put my bags in the car and headed to the hotel.</p>

    <p>Nature had set the perfect backdrop for my birthday adventure.  A light rain wet 
      the ground, the air thick and cold outside – just the kind of weather that makes 
      you want to get inside and get warm.</p>

    <p>I pulled into the hotel parking lot, surprised to see it was pretty full.  I went 
      into the lobby to check in. There was one person ahead of me.</p>

    <p>As I waited in line I kept asking my body if this is where we really wanted to go. 
      I kept getting a clear sense of “yes”, so I took a deep breath and reminded myself 
      to trust my guidance.</p>

    <p>I stepped up to the front desk and asked for a room.  The lady behind the counter 
      said it was my lucky night because they had only one room left.  I grinned and said 
      I felt very lucky.  She asked for my license and credit card.</p>

    <p>She looked at her computer screen for a moment and added, “And I’m really sorry, 
      but this room has a Jacuzzi tub. Will that be a problem?”</p>

    <p>It took a couple of seconds for what she said to register in my brain. Then I let 
      out a burst of laughter.</p>

    <p>“A Jacuzzi tub?” I asked in total surprise.</p>

    <p>“Yes,” she said, “I know some people don’t like them, so I wanted to let you know,
      in case you wanted to change your mind about the room.”</p>

    <p>She had no way of knowing how hilariously awesome it was to me that the one room 
      she had left had a Jacuzzi tub, and it just so happened I LOVE Jacuzzi tubs!</p>

    <p>At this point, I erupted in full blown giggles at the joy of such delightfully 
      surprising news.  I could feel the excitement in my body, in the gleeful expectation 
      of what a Jacuzzi tub meant for her!  I felt like I had just won a fabulous prize!</p>

    <p>“You have no idea how happy a Jacuzzi tub makes me,” I said. “I actually came here 
      to enjoy a hot bath for my birthday, and a Jacuzzi tub is perfect!”</p>

    <p>She laughed and wished me a happy birthday.  Then she printed up the room bill, 
      said the weekend rate was in effect and the total would be $45.  I giggled even 
      louder as I handed her the charge card, amazed by what was taking place.</p>

    <p>I had not put any specific expectation out for this experience other than having 
      a hot bath, and the Universe delivered to me a room with a Jacuzzi tub at less than 
      the weekday rate!  How does it get even better than that?</p>

    <p>I drove around the building to find my room.  It was in a perfect spot near the back 
      of the property where it was quiet.  Behind the property was a large pasture and the 
      soft night lighting of the moon and stars.</p>

    <p>I got my bag and went to the door, still giggling to myself at the way this experience 
      was unfolding.  I opened the door, stepped into the room, and there it was: the Jacuzzi 
      tub.  I walked over to it and just marveled at it for a minute.  It was huge!  And it 
      was mine for the night!</p>

    <p>I turned the heat on to warm up the room and set up the space: clothes, towels, candles 
      out, iPad set, and music on.</p>

    <p>It had been quite a while since I had gotten to do this, and every part of it felt 
      particularly yummy.  I savored each step, each action, being even more present to 
      the sacredness of this ritual on this night.</p>

    <p>I filled the tub almost to the top and slowly slid into the water.  It was as hot as 
      I could stand it, and it came all the way up over my shoulders.  I breathed in the scent 
      of the oils in the water and on my skin and let the soft glow of the candle light in 
      the rising steam carry all my cares away in this oh-so-peaceful, perfect moment.</p>

    <p>As I melted into the sheer bliss of the experience it occurred to me: my body, 
      the Universe, <em>and</em> I had co-created this.  It had not occurred to me in this 
      way before, but at this moment I was so aware of her part in this creation, and I was 
      in awe.</p>

    <p>I would never have thought to ask for a Jacuzzi tub, yet the Universe knew how much 
      I loved them.  I never would have imagined this hotel even had Jacuzzi tubs, yet the 
      Universe knew!  And my body was totally willing to assist me in receiving the guidance 
      to get there.</p>

    <p> would never have imagined I could have a room with a Jacuzzi tub at a price that 
      worked for me. Yet when I became willing to let go of my resistance and my reasons 
      for not choosing something I actually desired, I got out of the Universe’s way, and 
      it brought a perfect experience for me and my body to enjoy.</p>

    <p>I sat in total gratitude and wonder of how the elements of that day had come together 
      so perfectly, so brilliantly – and on my birthday.  Happy Birthday, Body ... Happy 
      Birthday to Us ... and Thank You, Universe!</p>

    <p>That forty-somethingth birthday continues to give me inspiration and awareness.  
      In the moments that I slip into feelings of doubt or uncertainty, I am reminded of 
      my birthday bath and how completely the whole of the Universe is right here with me, 
      knowing me intimately, ready to co-create with me at every moment, and oh so excitedly 
      willing to deliver to me what I truly desire in greater ways than I can imagine!</p>

  <h5 class="h5  bottom0">Making Changes</h5>
  <h6 class="h6">by Galina Shadrova</h6>

  <p>A man in his late sixties made an appointment in my Tarzana, California office. 
    When the man walked into my room, he nervously stated, “I don’t think you will 
    be able to hypnotize me, but you were highly recommended from my friend, and I 
    would like to give it a chance.”</p>

  <p><em>This is a really promising beginning,</em> I thought.</p>

  <p>All his life he was the provider for the family, and everybody constantly 
    acknowledged him for it. This made him very happy.</p>

  <p>Time passed. He got older and lost his job with little savings for his retirement, 
    resulting in him lashing out at his wife and kids. He feared that they would leave him.</p>

  <p>After the first session he awoke happy and relaxed and immediately made another 
    appointment for nine days later.  He returned for the second session in an angry 
    mood. He screamed that the hypnosis did not work and that this would be his last 
    session.</p>

  <p>“Okay. That is absolutely fine, but as long as you are here tell me about this past 
    week,” I said.</p>

  <p>“After the first session I was calm and happy and everything at home began to feel good. 
    However, the past two days I began yelling again, and everything became bad again,” he 
    replied.</p>

  <p>I never promised to fix his entire problem in one session. I am a clinical hypnotherapist, 
    not a magician!</p>

  <p>Usually hypnotherapy works for about seven days. Then you must do it again to reinforce 
    it. I hypnotized him again, and he fell into a very deep hypnotic state (so much for not 
    being hypnotizable). Afterward, he decided to make another appointment for seven days 
    later.</p>

  <p>After several sessions his wife called me and asked, “What did you do to my husband? 
    He is a totally different person. I don’t think I’ve ever seen him so happy. After 20 
    years together, we are planning a second honeymoon. Life is great. Thank you!”</p>

  <p>Two months later, he called me again for an appointment, asking for my help to get a 
    job and make more money. He entered my office with a smile on a much younger looking 
    face and with confidence stated, “Everything is good in my life, and I am very happy, 
    but because of my age no one wants to give me a job. My wife is still working, and I 
    would like to make some extra money. Is that possible?”</p>

  <p>Time for Law of Attraction! After two sessions he got job with a 10 minute drive from 
    his home twice a week. After a couple more sessions, another employee left, and the 
    owner offered him two more days of work per week.</p>

  <p>He recently e-mailed me about how he was now working six day a week and had won $500.00 
    from the lottery.</p>

  <p></p>

  <p>I got another call from a woman who said she wanted to make an appointment to help cure 
    her of depression.</p>

  <p>I asked her if she knew that this was a hypnotherapist’s office and that she would need 
    a doctor’s referral for me to help her with her depression.</p>

  <p>“I didn’t know that this is a hypnotherapist’s office. I just called because somebody 
    told me that you would be able to help. I am glad you are hypnotherapist! I believe that 
    hypnosis is my last hope. I saw a psychiatrist for three years and even asked shamans 
    for help. I do not want to live, but I can’t leave my children. On weekends I do not 
    feel like getting out of bed.”</p>

  <p>When she entered my office, I saw a woman without make up and a tired face in her 50s.</p>

  <p>She got divorced after 27 years of marriage. Her husband left her for a much younger 
    woman. Her oldest son lived alone, but her two teenage kids still lived with her.</p>

  <p>I advised her to have hypnotherapy sessions twice a week until they were not needed 
    anymore.</p>

  <p>For the second session, she came in with a nice hair cut and pretty make up, and she 
    was beautifully dressed.</p>

  <p>I knew hypnosis helped, but <em>that fast?</em></p>

  <p>Two more sessions later, she declared, “I want to make repairs in my bedroom. I already 
    bought wallpaper and began to apply it myself.”</p>

  <p>I switched her to one session per week.</p>

  <p>She decided to take a few private drawing lessons. 
    Her life became more and more enjoyable.</p>

  <p>A few months later, I got a call from her. She said that she was ready to start dating 
    again but did not know how to find the right person.</p>

  <p>It was time for her to learn about the Law of Attraction. We had a total of five sessions 
    in which I taught her what she should do for herself.</p>

  <p>Six months later she called me and said that she had met a man with whom 
    she is now very happy!</p>

    <p>Louise and I celebrated our 13th wedding anniversary in September 2012 
      by doing the first-ever podcast of LOA Today. We had a grand total of zero listeners.</p>

    <p>Less than a month later, my brother, Mark, and future sister-in-law, Uohna, did 
      the second podcast with us. Both podcasts had technical difficulties, and our 
      listenership hadn’t increased at all. </p>

    <p>Again, zero listeners.</p>

    <p>By this point, I was the only one of the four who really wanted to do the podcasts 
      on a consistent basis. Why? Because the podcasts were part of my own efforts to 
      improve my mindset, they felt good to do, and I enjoyed the whole process, despite 
      not having any listeners.</p>

    <p>Well, I did have a few listeners after awhile. Not enough to shake a stick at, b
      ut hey! It’s better than zero listeners, right?</p>

    <p>About five years before this, in November 2008, I was despairing the world’s 
      financial state of affairs (as well as our own) following the onset of the financial 
      crisis. I knew that my own business was completely at risk. Since 2003 I had been 
      self-employed full-time building websites for small businesses and non-profit 
      organizations, and most of my customers were very small non-profits. I knew enough 
      about economics to know that my non-profit customers were very likely to shrink in 
      number dramatically as the consequences of the financial crisis emerged over the 
      next couple years. I had no clear idea what to do about it.</p>

    <p>Louise had her gardening business, but since I’d had the foresight to know that 
      the financial crisis was not only coming (I’d predicted it about a year before it 
      happened), I knew that it would likely have devastating consequences for her business 
      too. So she decided to sell it. After all, when money gets tight, gardening services 
      become an unjustifiable luxury that people stop paying for.</p>

    <p>So she found another gardener to sell her business to, getting a small sum of cash 
      in return. While it wouldn’t last, it would at least give us a bit of help.</p>

    <p>More importantly, however, she sat me down one day and said to me something like, 
      “Are you aware of just how negative you’ve become?”</p>

    <p>No, I wasn’t aware of it. In fact, I protested that I thought I was a pretty 
      positive person, all things considered. But as we talked, it became more and 
      more clear that I had far more negative thoughts going through my head in those 
      days than I’d previously admitted. In fact, the closer I looked at my behavior, 
      the less I liked what I saw.</p>

    <p>So by November 2008, I was not only in despair, but I was thrashing around for 
      any possible solution I could find.</p>

    <p>The year before I had watched this movie/phenomenon known as <em>The Secret,</em> and 
      while I was a disbeliever in anything metaphysical, I was willing to give it a try. 
      Heck, I was willing to give almost anything a try.</p>

    <p>I ordered a copy of the movie and watched it. When I did, two things happened. 
      On the one hand, something deep inside resonated with the contents of the movie. 
      On the other hand, my subconscious mind screamed at me, “Are you crazy? That’s 
      a bunch of hooey!”</p>

    <p>The battle raged in my mind for a few years afterward as I awkwardly tried, sometimes 
      succeeded, and often failed to be a deliberate creator in my own life. Somewhat to my 
      surprise, I refused to let go of this Law of Attraction notion despite the 
      disappointments and failures. My attitude had improved marginally, but not enough 
      that most people would have noticed the change. Consequently I still had more bad 
      things happening to me with my business and with life in general than good ones.</p>

    <p>By April 2012, became a bit of an obsession with me. One day when Mark and Uohna 
      came to visit, I decided to risk bringing up this controversial topic among the 
      four of us. After much discussion, I proposed the idea of doing something together, 
      something like a podcast, on the subject of the Law of Attraction. There were sniffs 
      of interest from everyone, but it didn’t go any further at this point.</p>

    <p>It wasn’t until the following September that I took the bull by the horns and decided 
      to go for it. After the first two podcasts, I started reaching out to anyone I could 
      find on Twitter interested in the Law of Attraction, and I ended up setting up 
      interviews to do on my podcast, some of which Louise was able to participate in. 
      They were good interviews, and they continued to whet my appetite for more. </p>

    <p>But soon my wave of interviewees diminished to a trickle, and I was finding it hard 
      to keep up. By the following summer, I took an extended break from the podcasts, even 
      though LOA was still a major interest of mine. </p>

    <p>Then a series of events began to occur before I got it going again, events that 
      would change our lives substantially forever.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <h6 class="left">LOUISE</h6>

    <p>It was the summer of 2013 in Northern Virginia, and I was well aware of the Law of 
      Attraction and how thinking about something could draw it to you.</p>

    <p>I was going to need a new vehicle in the not-too-distant future. I had been driving 
      a 2001 Ford Ranger pickup for a number of years because I needed the cargo room to 
      haul supplies and materials to the job site for my garden design and maintenance 
      company.</p>

    <p>When the economy took a nose dive, I sold the company. I kept the pickup, but the 
      truck’s lack of comfort for the driver and the lack of cab space for groceries and 
      other personal purchases had me considering driving something else.</p>

    <p>I still wanted cargo room for all my finds at garage and tag sales. I would buy 
      low and take the items to local consignment shops to sell for a small profit. By 
      no means did this hobby provide significant income. It was just fun. </p>

    <p>An SUV seemed like a good fit, but what make and model? Since I didn’t need to 
      be concerned with <strong><em>how</em></strong> I was going to make this happen 
      (since trying to figure out “how” it’s going to happen is a no-no where deliberate 
      creation is concerned), I decided to aim high. Lexus being a Toyota product, and 
      me being a previous Camry owner three times over, meant I wanted to explore a Lexus 
      to make sure it really fit my needs. </p>

    <p>The fact that we didn’t have the money for it didn’t enter into the picture.</p>

    <p>So off to the Lexus dealer my husband and I went to act as if we could purchase 
      something in the near future. In Law of Attraction lore, this is sometimes referred 
      to as “deliberate creation.” Another word for it is “play.” We needed to visualize 
      and believe that we could buy such a vehicle even if we didn’t have the funds at 
      the moment. </p>

    <p>We alerted the salesman of our intentions, and he seemed okay with us asking 
      questions and trying the car on for size. I liked the amenities and comfort, but 
      the headroom wasn’t right for my tall husband. It was a better vehicle than a 
      sedan, but maybe not for hauling pieces of furniture, since the back seat didn’t 
      fold down.</p>

    <p>So we went back to our day-to-day lives, and since money was tight, I didn’t 
      seriously consider buying a new vehicle until one fateful day ...</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h6 class="left">WALT</h6>

    <p>That summer was eventful for a couple of reasons. Not only were we imagining 
      and dreaming about new cars (my car was on its last legs, too), but we also 
      acquired new, furry additions to our family. </p>

    <p>One day in July, the people who lived across the street from us got evicted, 
      although we didn’t know it at the time. About a month later, Louise found a 
      nearly all-black cat lurking in the front yard. She tried to lure the cat 
      inside, but the cat ran away. </p>

    <p>The next day, the same cat appeared. She lured it to the house because it 
      looked hungry. The only thing even close to cat food that we had was some 
      leftover swordfish from the previous evening. Oh well ... the poor cat would 
      have to settle for a swordfish dinner!</p>

    <p>We had both grown up with cats, and we had often talked about how it would 
      be great to have two cats in our lives: his &amp; hers cats, so to speak. Louise 
      saw this cat’s appearance as an answer to our prayers.</p>

    <p>She lured the cat inside and tried keeping it inside, but despite enjoying 
      some attention from us, the cat clearly wanted out. So she let it out.</p>

    <p>The next day, there was no sign of the cat. We wondered what happened to her, 
      particularly because she seemed malnourished. A day later, when the cat still 
      didn’t appear, we went looking for her. We’d seen her lurking across the street, 
      so we walked over there.</p>

    <p>As I looked around, I heard a very high-pitched mew under the car in their 
      driveway, and out popped a small black cat that looked remarkably like our 
      swordfish-loving visitor, except there was clearly something wrong with her 
      front paw. <em>My God,</em> I thought … <em>it looks broken!</em> It bent at 
      an unnatural angle, and the cat hobbled on it awkwardly, not to mention that 
      she looked even more malnourished than before. <em>Was that even possible?</em></p>

    <p>Louise called out, “Is that her?”</p>

    <p>I stared at the cat for a moment, perplexed and perturbed.</p>

    <p>“I don’t know,” I replied. “She looks like she’s been hurt.”</p>

    <p>I picked the cat up, and she struggled a bit to get away, but very feebly. 
      If you said this cat weighed four pounds, I’d have laughed at you. She was so 
      thin and malnourished, I would have said two pounds, even though she was clearly 
      fully grown.</p>

    <p>I couldn’t see specifically what was wrong with her paw, but my emotions had 
      gotten the better of me, and I was determined to get this cat some food and, 
      if necessary, some medical attention.</p>

    <p>So I walked back to our house carrying this small, furry bundle. Around the same 
      time as we got her some food, another black cat … clearly the first one who visited 
      us the day before … made her appearance. So there were two of them!</p>

    <p>I was still feeling upset about this second cat’s apparent injury, and I told 
      Louise I wanted to go over and confront the owner about it. She convinced me to 
      wait until after lunch, which we did.</p>

    <p>We took the second cat inside to feed both her and the first cat. This second cat, 
      whom we later named Harmony, had a very peculiar habit. Apparently, she’d gotten 
      the short end of the food stick for so long that she’d developed the habit of 
      growling as she chewed her food, with a suspicious look at anyone … human or 
      animal … lurking nearby. I’d never heard a sound like that: <em>rwar, rwar, rwar</em> 
      as she ate her precious meal, growling a new growl with every chew.</p>

    <p>We learned that the people across the street had just moved in, and they 
      told us that they’d found the cats there when they’d arrived. That’s also how 
      we learned that the previous occupants had been evicted. We then learned that 
      there were actually four cats, not two, and to complicate matters the new 
      family had four dogs of their own. Four dogs plus four abandoned cats did not 
      add up to a happy family in their book.</p>

    <p>Just as we talked, a third, very large light gray cat came strolling around 
      the corner of the house like he owned the place. The woman we spoke with said 
      there was also a fourth one around somewhere. She was hoping to find a way to 
      keep the cats, but apparently her husband was against it.</p>

    <p>To complicate matters even more, we were renting our home, and our lease said 
      clearly, “No pets.”</p>

    <p>It didn’t look good for the cats. </p>

    <p>I looked at Louise and knew instantly that she wanted to keep all of them. 
      I liked the idea of cats too, but three of them? Maybe four? And what would 
      our landlord say when he found out?</p>

    <p>She convinced me to play it by ear. Three cats came to our home that night. 
      We ended up naming them Joy, Harmony, and Yoda, which also represented the 
      order in which we found them (or they found us, depending upon your viewpoint).</p>

    <p>It turned out that Yoda, the gray cat with the Yoda-like eyes and ears, 
      regularly displayed an uncomfortable interest in Joy, the first black cat. 
      He’d chase her all over the house, and Joy didn’t like it! We inferred that 
      this meant they needed a trip to the vet to get fixed, and despite money being 
      tight, we found that the local animal shelter did this kind of work relatively 
      inexpensively. So we arranged appointments for all three.</p>

    <p>We acquired some pet carriers, and on the appointed day we took them to the shelter 
      and dropped them off. An hour later back at home, we received a phone call. We could 
      come pick them up.</p>

    <p>“Really? That was quick,” was my reaction.</p>

    <p>“Oh, we didn’t have to do anything with them,” the female voice at the other end of 
      the line told me. “They’ve already been neutered.”</p>

    <p>She explained that they previously had been fixed as part of an international 
      program designed to address the worldwide overpopulation of cats by capturing, 
      neutering, and releasing stray and feral cats. Some cats also get adopted this 
      way, and that’s what had happened with these cats.</p>

    <p>Why the evicted family who acquired them didn’t take them back to the shelter 
      but left them instead to fend for themselves … well, we never did get the answer 
      to that question.</p>

    <p>The way they knew the cats had already been neutered through that program was 
      that the cats’ ears had been “tipped,” the international sign for cats that had 
      been captured, neutered, and released.</p>

    <p>I’d just thought they had some kind of weird genetic mutation that made their 
      ears like that.</p>

    <p>“Oh, and Joy is actually a boy.”</p>

    <p>Well, that was certainly a surprise!</p>

    <p>We ended up having to keep them in separated areas of the house now that we knew 
      that Yoda’s interest in Joy was in driving away a rival rather than in something 
      more intimate. We definitely did not want cat fights inside the house! So Yoda 
      got the half-finished basement, and the two black cats lived upstairs with us.</p>

    <p>This was also the beginning of what we called, “The Kitty Cat Shuffle,” because 
      we had to find ways to give Yoda attention upstairs in order to keep everything 
      fair for all. So we played this little game where the two black cats would get 
      let outside for a bit, Yoda would come upstairs to spend time with us, then 
      we’d get him back downstairs, and the two black cats would come back inside while 
      Yoda went outside … and so on.</p>

    <p>Soon afterward, Louise sat me down to tell me that she wasn’t happy in Virginia. 
      Could we move back to Connecticut where we’d previously lived? </p>

    <p>Our home in Virginia sat in the middle of nowhere, about 50 miles from Washington, 
      D.C. just beyond the Manassas battlefields. It took an hour just to go … well, 
      almost anywhere. Grocery shopping was usually an all-day Saturday event.</p>

    <p>By contrast, Connecticut is a much smaller state where everything is much closer 
      together. Simsbury, the town we’d last lived in together, was full of all kinds of 
      interesting amenities, including a rails-to-trails bike and foot path, various 
      annual events like craft fairs and flea markets, the permanent site for the Hartford 
      Symphony Orchestra’s summer concert series, an annual fly-in at the local airport, 
      and other local activities, not to mention the Big E, a huge New England version 
      of a county fair that took place about a half hour from our home, plus the fact that 
      we lived within driving distance of Boston, New York, the shoreline, Cape Cod, and 
      a host of other interesting places to go and things to do.</p>

    <p>Louise wanted to move back to Simsbury. Because she had moved to Virginia 11 years 
      earlier with me without hesitation because I needed to help my parents with their 
      move from Smith Mountain Lake into a senior center in Lynchburg, there was no way 
      I was going to decline her request.</p>

    <p>The only problem, as usual, was money. 2008’s financial crash hadn’t been kind to us. 
      We didn’t have much money. Moving would wipe out what little retirement savings we had 
      left. Not for the first time in my life, I was terrified about how to make the money 
      work at retirement age … let alone how to make ends meet in the coming year.</p>

    <p>But like Louise, I had been studying the Law of Attraction, trying and often failing 
      to work it to our benefit. We needed to move back to Connecticut. She needed a job 
      (I was still self-employed, but my annual income was dwindling). We needed new cars. 
      We now had cats in the family, and we had no idea how to make any of it work.</p>

    <p>Toward the end of October, the weather man said we should expect a particularly cold 
      spell of weather with temperatures in the low twenties. Brrr!</p>

    <p>It was after 4 PM, and I was working in the second bedroom that served as my office.</p>

    <p>“WALT! There’s another one!” I heard Louise call from the back door.</p>

    <p>Coming out, sure enough I saw a fourth cat. This one was a mixture of browns and 
      grays. We’d caught an occasional glimpse of her in the yard during the past few 
      months, but now she was at our back door crying for help. Leaving her outside was 
      out of the question given the impending freeze that night, but where could we put 
      her?</p>

    <p>Time once again for The Kitty Cat Shuffle! We ended up giving her half the basement, 
      with the other half going to Yoda and a closed door between them. Louise resolved not 
      to name her in case we couldn’t keep her, so we just called her Lady.</p>

    <p>One day, as Louise was tending separately to Yoda and Lady, she accidentally left 
      the door open between the finished and unfinished sections of the basement. To her 
      alarm, she saw Yoda casually walk directly to where Lady sat … and Lady didn’t move!</p>

    <p>Yoda gave Lady a little sniff, then moved on to graze in Lady’s food dish.</p>

    <p>Hmm! Apparently these two not only knew each other, but they got along well, too!</p>

    <p>Shortly after that, we found the two of them perched on a table near the basement 
      slider door, admiring the view outside. Yoda was sprawled out like a <em>pasha,</em> 
      and Lady lay with her head using his butt as a pillow.</p>

    <p>Yes, they did indeed know each other! The Kitty Cat Shuffle now simplified somewhat. 
      However, the problems between the Blacks and the Grays, as we called the two pairs of 
      cats, hadn’t disappeared. </p>

    <p>One day, Louise called me from the basement to come quickly. I ran to the basement 
      stairs and ran halfway down to the landing before turning to start down the other 
      flight of stairs. </p>

    <p>There, at the foot of the stairs, I saw Louise standing with a worried look on her 
      face.  The two male cats, Yoda and Joy, were clearing spoiling for a fight right there 
      in front of her. They crouched facing each other, their noses about a six inches apart, 
      with their ears back and their eyes in a squint, both ready to pounce with claws 
      flying. I knew that in a moment I was about to see an all-out cat fight.</p>

    <p>Well, that wasn’t an acceptable situation. One or both of them could get seriously 
      hurt (not to mention the two of us if either of us tried to intervene). This would 
      mean some expensive medical bills, whether from a vet or from a medical doctor.</p>

    <p>So I did the only thing I could think to do in the moment. I started running 
      downstairs as loudly and quickly as I could. With my first step toward them, 
      the two cats raced off in opposite directions.</p>

    <p>Crisis averted.</p>

    <p>There were other, similar confrontations to handle between the two male cats, one 
      of which involved using a tennis racket as a temporary shield to block one of them 
      (without any harm to either of them), but fortunately none of those situations ever 
      came to bloodshed.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, the problem of how to pull off a move back to Connecticut combined with 
      the twin problem of needing new cars had become much more acute. As always, money 
      was the biggest issue, and we didn’t know what to do about it.</p>

    <p>So we did the only thing we could think of to do. We put it out to the Universe 
      that we needed help now! Then we drove to Connecticut to house hunt and look for 
      a job for Louise in the first week of November.</p>

    <p>Staying with an old friend in Connecticut cut down on our expenses, but we still 
      had to shave pennies. We had heard that an apartment was available in the complex 
      where we used to live in Simsbury 11 years before, but when we got there the person 
      who was supposed to meet us never showed up. The apartment got rented … to someone 
      else. Our other attempts to find work and housing also fell through. This was 
      heartbreaking because Simsbury is not a cheap place to live. Those apartments were 
      the lowest priced rents in the area, but they were also nearly the most we could 
      afford.</p>

    <p>Discouraged and with bruised egos, after finding nothing else available in our 
      budget, we tucked our tails between our legs, climbed back into my aging Camry, and 
      headed back to Virginia, having no idea what to do next.</p>

    <p>Knowing that if a move came up we’d have to find homes for the cats, I began a 
      campaign to find someone to adopt one or two of them. I posted pictures everywhere 
      I could find a place to post them, offering them to a good home, no charge.</p>

    <p>We hoped that Christmas might bring us good news, but Christmas came and went 
      without further developments with all these problems. The only good news that month 
      is that I got the urge to start doing podcasts again, arranging an interview with 
      one of my previous interviewees. That interview slowly got the podcast train inching 
      along again out of the station.</p>

    <p>By January, we decided that we really had nothing to lose. After all, the money was 
      almost gone, so what the heck! We kept our chins up, hoping and daring to believe 
      that somehow a miracle would happen to save us.</p>

    <p>We drove back up to Connecticut again, this time for a pre-arranged job interview 
      for Louise, and we finally got some good news. Louise got the job! Now we just 
      needed a home, preferably one where we could keep cats.</p>

    <p>Arriving again in Simsbury, we again checked out the apartment complex where we used 
      to live, but there were no units available. I asked the woman in the office if she 
      knew about any that might be coming available soon, but she couldn’t help us. </p>

    <p>Well, we’d come all this way, so I was determined to try something … anything … 
      to find a place to live that we could afford. After all, we couldn’t afford to keep 
      making fruitless trips. The fact that Louise had gotten employment cheered us up and 
      buoyed our spirits. Somehow, a home we could afford would appear … we hoped.</p>

    <p>I didn’t even dare to think what to do about cars or cats.</p>

    <p>I managed to find a local Realtor who specialized in helping renters. We met him, 
      and he turned out to be this older gentleman who had basically been selling real 
      estate since the town was founded, or so it seemed. Actually, the town is nearly 
      350 years old, but I wasn’t going to quibble about it.</p>

    <p>This Realtor said he’d sold the guy who built our old apartment the land to build 
      them on some 50 years previously. He tried to find something we could afford (which 
      was almost nothing) in their lists of available homes, but with no luck. Then he 
      made an interesting comment. He said that our ex-landlord also had other properties 
      around town and identified one on the other side of town, called Canal Place. Had 
      we tried there?</p>

    <p>Louise and I looked at each other. Canal Place? Never heard of it!</p>

    <p>The next morning, we called the landlord’s office again, and talked to the same 
      woman I’d spoken with yesterday. Did they have anything available at Canal Place? 
      “Yes,” she said. “There are two.”</p>

    <p>I thought, <em>Why didn’t she tell me that yesterday when I called about the other 
      apartments? Oh well, never mind.</em></p>

    <p>We arranged to see one of the apartments with the head maintenance guy later that 
      day. As we drove down the main road toward our turn, we passed a car repair garage 
      owned by the same mechanic we used who owned the garage on the other side of town 
      where we used to live, and I got a strange, prickly feeling running down my neck.</p>

    <p>When we made the turn and drove into the complex, what we saw created a bit of a 
      shock for us. The architecture was identical to the architecture of our old 
      apartment complex from 11 years prior. I guess it wasn’t a total surprise, since 
      it was the same landlord, but we thought the similarity bode well for us. Louise 
      commented that unless is was a really terrible apartment, she’d be okay with 
      living here.</p>

    <p>Upon walking into the apartment, it was like walking through Alice’s looking glass. 
      The apartment was a perfect mirror image of our old apartment 11 years before. Every 
      room was in the same place as before, but reversed as if you were looking at the 
      whole place through a mirror. </p>

    <p>Most miraculous of all, the rent was identical to what we had paid 11 years before 
      (and $250 less per month than what we paid in Virginia).</p>

    <p>We took it.</p>

    <p>That left three problems.</p>

    <p>First, we had to move, and we had to do it fast. Louise’s new employer wanted her 
      to start at once, and we managed to get them to agree to start two weeks later … but 
      no more. This meant we had two weeks to complete a move from Virginia to Connecticut 
      starting from scratch.</p>

    <p>Second, we had two very, very old cars. Louise needed to replace her 12-year-old 
      Ford pickup truck, and I absolutely HAD to replace my 15-year-old Camry with its 
      237,000 miles on it, because it might not survive the 500+ mile trip north again. 
      Where would the money come from? I had no idea. Plus, Louise wasn’t up to driving 
      a car north by herself.</p>

    <p>Third, we now had four cats. Fortunately, the lease of our new apartment allowed 
      us to have cats! Unfortunately, we were only allowed to have two.</p>

    <p>That meant we had to do the unthinkable. We had to pick two cats to keep while 
      trying to find homes for the other two, all while packing at break neck pace for 
      a move in two weeks while Louise continued to work her old job (which we couldn’t 
      afford to let her give up until the last minute.) </p>

    <p>We had just two weeks to get it all done. <em>Two weeks!</em></p>

    <p>We needed new cars, and we couldn’t afford them.</p>

    <p>We couldn’t drive up in the pickup because you can’t put two cats in pet carriers 
      in the back of a pickup truck in freezing January temperatures, not if you want them 
      to survive the trip. </p>

    <p>My old Camry probably wasn’t up to another trip.</p>

    <p>Plus we had a whole bunch of stuff that wouldn’t go in the moving van, so we needed 
      to bring it with us on moving day.</p>

    <p>And this move would wipe out the last of our retirement savings.</p>

    <p>ARRRRRGGGGH!</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h6 class="left">LOUISE</h6>

    <p>So, my husband and I were moving back to New England after being in Virginia 
      for 11 years. He sold his car the day before we moved on the advice of his 
      mechanic, who felt his 1998 Toyota Camry with 237,000 miles would not make 
      the trip north.</p>

    <p>When we contacted the moving company, they assured us that they could transport 
      my truck on a hitch behind the moving van. Fantastic! We had two cats and a myriad 
      of stuff we needed to bring with us, but not in the moving van. Add the two of us 
      to the mix of things we just couldn’t fit in the moving van in the dead of January.</p>

    <p>We arranged to rent an SUV, and Walt would drive. I was good for only about three 
      hours of actual driving time before my back would start to ache. This fact is very 
      important to what happened nex</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h6 class="left">WALT</h6>

    <p>Here’s how the sale of my old Camry went. I placed an ad on Craigs List to see if 
      I could get a buyer for it. I figured if I could get $500 for it, I’d be happy. I 
      advertised it for $800.</p>

    <p>Then I called around for moving companies and found one that would work with our 
      ever-shrinking budget. It would take every last penny we had, but they’d move us 
      lock, stock, and barrel.</p>

    <p>Best of all, I had an inspiration. Could they tow our pickup truck behind the moving 
      van? That way, we could rent an SUV for the trip to carry the cats and sundries. </p>

    <p>Yes, they could!</p>

    <p>Woo hoo! It was starting to come together.</p>

    <p>The afternoon before the move, I got a caller interested in buying the Camry while 
      I was out running an errand in it. Could we meet in an hour? <em>Sure!</em></p>

    <p>The buyer drove up dragging a car trailer behind him. I gave him the keys to the 
      car so he could check it out, then ducked inside to use the bathroom. When I came 
      out, he inquired, “Did you know that it was out of oil?”</p>

    <p><em>WHAT???</em></p>

    <p>I’d just driven it without any issues for about 40 miles just an hour before. 
      How could it not have any oil in it? But sure enough, when I checked the dip stick, 
      it was bone dry. It’s a wonder the oil deficit combined with engine heat didn’t 
      crack the engine block entirely.</p>

    <p>“I can’t give you $800 in light of this, but would you let it go for $500?” 
      my buyer asked me.</p>

    <p>I couldn’t believe my luck. $500 was exactly what I was hoping to get for it, 
      and now I was getting it for a car that clearly had a major oil leak.</p>

    <p>“Yeah, okay,” I said as nonchalantly as I could. He gave me five one-hundred 
      dollar bills, I signed over the title, we pushed the car onto his trailer, and 
      he drove off dragging it behind him.</p>

    <p>We had packed and prepared as best we could, but by moving day the next morning 
      we were barely three-fourths packed. The movers showed up early and started loading 
      stuff and boxes faster than I could dump stuff into them and throw a piece of tape 
      over the top. Louise was working like a mad woman trying to pack up the kitchen.</p>

    <p>Midway through the madness, the boss asked me for a pow-wow. I said sure.</p>

    <p>“I’m afraid there’s been a misunderstanding. I know the lady in our office said we 
      can tow your pickup truck, but the law doesn’t allow us to do that,” he informed me. 
      “I could get an expensive ticket for doing it.”</p>

    <p><em>Oh no! What could we do now?</em> I can do a lot when I have to, but I can’t 
      drive both a rented SUV and a pickup truck at the same time, and Louise can’t drive 
      more than three hours without her back screaming at her.</p>

    <p>Still, I had managed to sell a 15-year-old car with 237,000 miles on it and a major 
      oil leak the night before for $500, so anything was possible.</p>

    <p>One of his crew members approached us. “If you want to sell the pickup, I’d like 
      to buy it,” he said.</p>

    <p>Louise and I tried very hard to not let our jaws hit the ground.</p>

    <p>Our plan had been to tow the pickup to Connecticut, use it as a vehicle until we 
      could figure out a more permanent solution to our car problems, then sell it, maybe 
      even get some value in trade for it. I hoped to get maybe $1,000 for it.</p>

    <p>But now that we couldn’t tow it ...</p>

    <p>“Sure,” I said. “What do you have in mind?”</p>

    <p>“I’ll give you $1,500 for it,” he said.</p>

    <p>Louise and I couldn’t believe our luck. The employee didn’t have the cash with him, 
      so he asked the moving company boss for a loan against his salary. The boss looked 
      at the truck and said, “Well, I don’t think it’s worth that much. It’s probably 
      worth about $1,200.” So the boss cut $1,200 off the moving bill in exchange for 
      the pickup.</p>

    <p><em>Not bad for a $1,000 pickup truck.</em></p>

    <p>Maybe this move was going to work out after all.</p>

    <p>Sadly, the one thing that wasn’t working was figuring out the solution to the 
      problem of the cats. After much angst and agony, we agreed to keep Joy and Harmony 
      while finding homes for the other two. Unfortunately, despite the fact that I had 
      engaged in a feverish campaign to find someone to adopt them over a two month period, 
      we found no takers. Winter is not exactly the ideal time to try to find someone to 
      adopt a cat.</p>

    <p>So with a heavy heart Louise volunteered to take them to the animal shelter in the 
      hopes that someone would adopt them. This was a bit frightening because the shelter 
      was not a no-kill shelter. If after a period of time they couldn’t find a home for 
      the cats, the cats would have to be euthanized.</p>

    <p>This did nothing to improve our joint state-of-mind.</p>

    <p>The only good thing was that we still had to deal with the move, so that’s what 
      kept us going … that plus the firm belief (well, about as firm as gelatin anyway) 
      that the Law of Attraction would deliver the goods for us when we needed them.</p>

    <p>By late afternoon, the mover’s boss came to me again to say that the van was packed 
      solid and there were still a few items that they couldn’t fit into the van. They 
      couldn’t squeeze a teaspoon in anywhere … it was that jam packed from floor to 
      ceiling. The back of the truck looked like someone had taken our stuff and run 
      it through a compactor, it was so densely packed.</p>

    <p>I improvised a late dump run to literally dump the few less-desired pieces that 
      were left over before the dump closed. We made it with five minutes to spare, and 
      the moving van headed north to Connecticut.</p>

    <p>Once the moving van took off, we returned to the house to do some last minute 
      cleaning while it got dark outside (and inside too … we didn’t have any lamps in 
      the empty house any more except for the overhead fluorescent kitchen light and 
      lights in the two bathrooms). Then we packed the cats and the stuff we were hauling 
      ourselves into the rental SUV and hit the road for an eight hour drive … starting at 
      8 PM.</p>

    <p>It was a long drive, but it went well. The cats did surprisingly well, except for 
      the last hour when Harmony kept crying that she needed out. We figured that she 
      needed to pee, but everything was packed away, including the litter box. Well, 
      we somehow made it to our new home at 4 AM, set up the litter box for the cats, 
      threw an air mattress on the floor, and went to sleep.</p>

    <p>45 minutes later, the moving van boss called my cell phone to tell me that they’d 
      arrived. Could we let them in so they could unload our stuff?</p>

    <p>The rest of that day is a blur, but we got moved in, boxes everywhere. 
      That night, as we ate our well-deserved evening meal away from the mess, 
      Louise and I discussed the fact that we didn’t own a car. The only car we 
      had was a rental, and we couldn’t afford to keep paying $39 plus tax per 
      day for it.</p>

    <p>So the next morning I went online and did some searching, trying to find cars 
      we could afford. It was a tall order, because we had no money for a down payment 
      and couldn’t afford much in the way of car payments. We didn’t like it, but maybe 
      we might have to settle for one old used car that we’d share. How we’d make that 
      work day-to-day we had no idea.</p>

    <p>Add in the fact that I stand 6’8” tall and that there are very few vehicles 
      that can accommodate my height, and you can understand that the list of possible 
      vehicle options gets very small quickly.</p>

    <p>My online search proved fruitless.</p>

    <p>A Toyota had saved our lives in an accident many years before, so we felt loyal 
      to the brand. We ended up at a Toyota dealership near the Massachusetts border, 
      and they convinced us to consider leasing instead of buying a used car in order 
      to get a slightly lower monthly payment. At this point, I was willing to try 
      anything, but I still didn’t see how we could afford two cars … and we really 
      needed two cars! They tentatively got us to put $100 toward a lease, with the 
      understanding that we could cancel if we found something better.</p>

    <p>The next morning, we were getting desperate. We headed to another dealership near 
      our new home to make one last attempt. There was a snowstorm coming, but we figured, 
      <em>what the heck,</em> as we asked the snowstorm to hold off for a bit.</p>

    <p>We walked into the dealership and met Jose, who would be our salesman. It was 
      also a Toyota dealership. We told them our sad financial story and asked them 
      if they could do anything to help us.</p>

    <p>One of their V.Ps’s, another man also named Jose, got involved and said he was 
      going to make sure we had two cars no matter what it took.</p>

    <p>They ended up putting me in the same car that the other dealership had (a Camry), 
      and I liked it, but I told them sadly that I didn’t see how we could swing it. Even 
      at the lease price, we couldn’t afford a second car ... and we really needed that 
      second car. </p>

    <p>They kept crunching numbers, lowering the price. I thanked them for their efforts, 
      but we just couldn’t afford it.</p>

    <p>Finally, Jose the V.P. said, “Okay, here’s what we’re going to to. We’re going to 
      give you a lease on the Camry at our cost.” That amounted to about a 40% savings on 
      the lease price. I loved the idea, but what about a car for Louise? We’d been looking 
      at a late model Corolla for her. The payment on it worked, but she hated the one we’d 
      been looking at, and there were no other used cars on the lot.</p>

    <p>By this time, it was about 3 PM. We’d been there over six hours, and Louise had a 
      headache. So did I, if I was honest about it. We agreed she would take the rental 
      car to go home to the boxes and a well-deserved nap, while I’d sign up to lease the 
      Camry. The next morning, we’d return the rental and then try to figure out something 
      about a car for her.</p>

    <p>She left, and about two minutes later, Jose the V.P. asked, “Where’s Louise?</p>

    <p>I told him.</p>

    <p>He replied, “Call her back.”</p>

    <p>“Why?”</p>

    <p>“Because we’re going to lease her a brand new Corolla, also at dealer cost, for the same, 
      low monthly payments we were going to sell her for the used car.”</p>

    <p>In shock, I called Louise to come back and went to pick her up. The bottom line is 
      that we drove home in the snowstorm that finally showed up later that day with two 
      brand new cars, the first time in either of our lives that we had owned a new car.</p>

    <p>And we did it with no money in our pockets and at incredibly, impossibly discounted 
      prices.</p>

    <p>So life was good, right? I mean, with some huge help from the Universe, we’d pulled 
      off the impossible. We had moved to Connecticut, got two brand new cars, Louise had a 
      new job, we brought two cats with us, and all was well.</p>

    <p>Well, almost. </p>

    <p>First, within a week, Louise hated her job so much that she quit. It was in day care, 
      and she was able to land another job with another day care right away. Improvement was 
      good. </p>

    <p>But within about a month, Louise started to experience pain in her legs and feet. 
      It got so bad that she could barely walk, let alone do her job. Clearly, something 
      had to change fast.</p>

    <p>On top of that, there were still two cats in the animal shelter in Virginia, and 
      it was <strong><em>not</em></strong> a no-kill shelter. The shelter has a website 
      that enabled me to track their progress, and I was happy to report to Louise by 
      March that Lady had been adopted out of the shelter. But Yoda was still there, 
      and while there were cats that had been there far longer, Louise felt really 
      upset about it.</p>

    <p>So she started reaching out to people she knew in Virginia, people she’d worked 
      with, etc. Would any of them have any interest in adopting a beautiful light gray 
      cat named Yoda? One of them pointed her to a former co-worker who rescued animals. 
      Might Mony be interested? It turned out that … Yes! Mony loved Yoda and adopted him 
      on the spot.</p>

    <p>Drinks of relief all around.</p>

    <p>Today, Joy is our ambassador to our apartment neighborhood, introducing himself 
      to every passing neighbor willing to stop and pet him.</p>

    <p>Harmony, the one with the bum paw whom I estimated weighed about two pounds, 
      improved considerably over time to the point that we realized that her paw 
      problem is probably due to a birth defect. She still hobbles, but she gets 
      around just fine, and she’s definitely not hungry any more. She probably weighs 
      10-12 lbs now and could even stand to be on a bit of a diet. She may be a little 
      chunky, but we love her anyway.</p>

    <p>And Yoda and Lady are living happily ever after with their new families.</p>

    <p>Now we only had to deal with the fact that Louise was in pain every day and hated 
      her job. Plus, while we had somehow miraculously manifested a new home and two brand 
      new cars with almost no money, plus had two new members to the family … well, let’s 
      just say that the money problems were still around. What to do?</p>

    <p>A visit to a podiatrist led to adding off-the-shelf insoles to her shoes at a far 
      lower cost than we expected, which helped clear up the pain. However, she didn’t 
      want to stay in day care any more. Maybe she should start up the gardening business 
      again? So she did, but this time she’d do it by hiring help to do the work.</p>

    <p>The first year was a good one, although it didn’t generate a lot of income. It did, 
      however, see Mark and Uohna become my co-hosts of the LOA Today podcast starting in 
      August, a team that held together for another year with Uohna and I doing most of 
      the podcasts together while Mark sat in occasionally.</p>

    <p>The second year, Louise doubled her business size. Uohna and Mark quit doing the 
      podcasts, so I contacted Joel Elston, who had been one of my first year interviewees, 
      to ask him if he’d like the spot. He accepted quickly. That was great news!</p>

    <p>The third year, Gardens By Louise doubled its business again, although my own business 
      continued to decline.</p>

    <p>Last year, her gardening business became our main source of income while my own 
      business practically fell apart, just in time to turn in her Corolla at the end 
      of the lease period and buy a used Toyota Sienna that she could use as a cargo 
      van, one that had all the bells and whistles and was in fantastic condition for 
      a used vehicle. I turned in my lease as well for another brand new Camry.</p>

    <p>In April, Joel found himself in a new work situation and with a new foster son 
      in his life, and he didn’t have enough hours in the day. So he regretfully 
      withdrew as my co-host on the weekly podcast of LOA Today.</p>

    <p>A month later, I found David Scott Bartky, and he became my new co-host.</p>

    <p>Louise’s business got so busy that it threatened her health last summer, both 
      mentally and physically. So I stepped in to help in a big way.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, something amazing started to happen with the LOA Today podcast. While 
      I now had listeners, I was lucky if I had 25-50 total “plays” in a month. </p>

    <p>But when David and I began to do a series of episodes on the topic of the book, 
      <em>Ask And It Is Given,</em> by Jerry and Esther Hicks (with Abraham), our 
      listenership started to rise. </p>

    <p>During that same time, I made a big push to urge listeners to subscribe to the 
      podcast so that they could get a permanent feed of shows to their smart phones … 
      and it worked!</p>

    <p>By September, the growth path in LOA Today’s listenership numbers was skyrocketing 
      at an amazing rate.</p>

    <p>By November, they’d reached some serious levels. We were getting more “plays” in a 
      month than we’d gotten in all of the previous years combined!</p>

    <p>Louise and I talked about it, and she could see how much doing the podcasts meant 
      to me. I’d been working hard all of this time to improve my attitude, and the weekly 
      podcast had really helped me in that regard. </p>

    <p>I wanted to do the podcast daily instead of weekly, since I now could hardly wait 
      for Sundays (the day David and I did our recordings) to arrive each week. Since we 
      were in the gardening off-season, she said to go ahead and see where the podcast 
      would take me.</p>

    <p>So I reached out to seven more LOA coaches I found online, and three of them: 
      Wendy Dillard, Cindie Chavez, and Tom Wells, came on board exactly one day after 
      I put out my feelers. WOW! Now that’s what I call responsiveness. Thanks, Universe!</p>

    <p>Wendy and Cindie soon told me about experiences they’d had contributing to 
      multi-author books that had sold well, which gave me the inspiration to create 
      the book you now hold in your hands.</p>

    <p>This year, we’re fully expecting to break records again with Louise’s business, 
      finally shooting us solidly into the black. The gardening season is already under 
      way, she has seven employees, and April 2018 turned out to be a record April for 
      the business.</p>

    <p>I now spend time six days per week doing the LOA Today podcasts while helping 
      Louise manage the growth of her exploding gardening business. </p>

    <p>Add in my role in putting together and editing this book, and you can see that 
      life has gotten better and better.</p>

    <p>Today, I smile every day. My own mental attitude has improved immensely. Everyone 
      close to me has noticed it in a big way, and each step of the way where my attitude 
      improved, what followed was yet another advance in a series of steps like what you 
      just read.</p>

    <p>We’re now hunting for a house of our own to buy, instead of our small apartment, 
      and of course we’re using the Law of Attraction to make it happen. We’re currently 
      looking at houses that are way, way, way out of our price range, picking and 
      choosing what we like and what we don’t like, piecing together our ideal house 
      while dreaming really, really big. We even found one, right next door to some kids 
      Louise took care of when we first arrived. It meets all of our needs. We just need 
      to figure out the money.</p>

    <p>Want to bet that we won’t find a way to get it? Here’s a hint: it’s a sucker’s bet!</p>

    <h5 class="h5 bottom0">All is Well</h5>
    <h6 class="h6">by Susan Murray</h6>

    <p>With my husband’s death grip on the steering wheel, our minivan careened down 
      I-540 keeping pace with the ambulance ahead of us. What began as concern that one 
      of our children was dehydrated after a night of vomiting became one of the most 
      harrowing experiences of our lives.</p>

    <p>Barely 15 hours earlier, our sweet family of five: mama, papa, daughter Laura, 
      just shy of 15, and our two sons, Eamon, aged 13, and Liam, almost 10, had just 
      completed our final Saturday night community theater performance of Oliver! We 
      looked forward to the final Sunday matinee performance the following day, and the 
      next chapter in our lives promised an overseas adventure for which we had been 
      preparing for eight long months.</p>

    <p>Laura, a member of an elite all-girl’s choir, had labored over knit goods she 
      sold in the community. She developed a loyal following of people who appreciated 
      her artistry and talent and were happy to pay for it. Together, the kids and I 
      began a small house-cleaning service to help further secure the funds necessary 
      for Laura to travel with her choir to Salzburg to perform in the Mozart Festival 
      that summer.</p>

    <p>Ours was a single-income, unschooling family. Funds may have been scarce, but 
      love and generosity were abundant. Even in our more cash-strapped times, through 
      the love and generosity of others, we managed to get what we needed and even much 
      of what we desired. Dennis, Laura, and I intended that Laura would travel to 
      Salzburg with her choir, and we were open and willing to do whatever was in our 
      power to get her there.</p>

    <p>Just when we’d nearly secured Laura’s travel fare, my mother decided to give Eamon 
      and me the gift of joining Laura on this once-in-a-lifetime adventure. We spent 
      several months studying German,  planning and preparing for our European excursion. 
      With Saturday’s performance “in the can,” we had just one more matinee until we 
      could begin the countdown and fully devote our energy to our upcoming trip to 
      Austria!</p>

    <p>Following that Saturday night performance, after changing out of her costume, 
      Laura complained of nausea and headache. A viral infection had been plaguing much 
      of the cast over the past couple weeks. We were grateful our family managed to avoid 
      it up to that point but assumed Laura was an unhappy recipient of the nasty bug. 
      What we wouldn’t know until days later is that she collapsed backstage during the 
      curtain call, requiring her scrambling cast mates to help her to her feet. Like a 
      consummate theater professional, she mustered the strength to walk out on stage and 
      take her bow.</p>

    <p>Once home from the theater, I did a web search of her symptoms: she was severely 
      nauseated without fever, and had headache radiating down the sides of her neck. 
      My little visit to “fearmongers dot com” did little to assuage our concerns, but 
      Dennis and I put her to bed, giving her some Boswellia extract to relieve her pain, 
      and then tag-teamed staying with her throughout the night. By morning, we were 
      finally convinced there was something seriously wrong with our beautiful daughter.</p>

    <p>On Sunday morning, Dennis gingerly placed Laura into the van, and we drove to our 
      local emergency room where a CT scan revealed she suffered a potentially fatal brain 
      hemorrhage.</p>

    <p>In an instant, a life full of hope, joy, and promise was turned on its head.</p>

    <p>We had no idea what lay ahead of us, but we knew that, though our lives were about 
      to be altered irrevocably, allowing ourselves to be beaten down by unforeseen 
      circumstances was not an option.</p>

    <p>Dennis and I had weathered many storms over the course of our 25-year relationship. 
      Whether it was due to the power of prayer, gratitude, affirmations, or the deep, 
      abiding belief that “all is well,” every time we pulled through and overcame whatever 
      hardship threatened to destroy the life we’d built together.</p>

    <p>We were determined this time would be no different.</p>

    <p>Matching the ambulance mile for mile, Dennis and I endured a fairly silent 30 
      minute drive from our local emergency room in Raleigh, NC, to the Duke University 
      Medical Center E.R. in Durham. We may not have spoken many words, but our hearts 
      and minds hummed in harmony: <em>All is well. All is well. All is well…</em></p>

    <p>Scans revealed that a mass in the fourth ventricle of Laura’s brain was the 
      cause of the hemorrhage; she would require emergency surgery to remove the mass 
      and repair the bleeding.</p>

    <p>Facing such a terrifying and unexpected event, I immediately began looking for 
      what was going <strong><em>right</em></strong> that day and found many things 
      worthy of gratitude.</p>

    <p>Despite this emergency occurring on the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend, an 
      internationally respected pediatric neurosurgeon was on call, and Laura was in 
      a world-class medical facility near our home rather than on an airplane 30,000 
      feet over the Atlantic, which could have easily been her fate had the brain 
      bleed occurred three weeks later.</p>

    <p>Despite living a 10-hour car ride away, my mother found a direct flight from 
      Cleveland to Raleigh, allowing her to arrive at the hospital before Laura was 
      wheeled into surgery, thanks to dear friends who conveyed her from the airport 
      to the medical center and then hosted her in their Durham home overnight.</p>

    <p>Thanks to the coordinated efforts of dear friends in our home town, not only 
      were our sons able to participate in the final matinee performance with the 
      community theater, but they were cared for in our absence.</p>

      <p>Home-prepared, nutritious food was brought to us at the hospital.</p>
      
      <p>We were surrounded by the people who loved us most and supported by the 
        rapidly expanding circle of prayer and affirmation warriors who blanketed us 
        with the energy of healing, protection, and God’s Highest and Best outcome 
        for this untenable situation.</p>

      <p>Our daughter sailed through the surgery, which took less time than 
        anticipated. The surgeon was confident he removed 100% of the mass.</p>

      <p>My husband and I brought great comfort and support to each other, and our 
        different perspectives helped balance and strengthen our decision-making process.</p>

      <p>More friends and acquaintances, some traveling great distances, came to the 
        hospital to comfort us and support Laura.</p>

      <p>We had a lot to be grateful for.</p>

      <p>Laura enjoyed a robust recovery following the trauma of surgery. But though 
        we held out hope the mass was a benign tumor, the results were not in our 
        favor. Diagnosis: medulloblastoma, an aggressive childhood brain cancer.</p>

      <p>It’s easy for hope, faith, and the enduring trust that, “the Universe has 
        your back” to quaver in the face of immense challenges. Holding on to the trust 
        that all is well when all physical evidence points to the contrary is itself 
        a major feat of manifesting.</p>

      <p>My husband has always been the more optimistic person between the two of us. 
        It comes naturally to him to see his glass as perpetually overflowing. I, on 
        the other hand, have my work cut out for me whenever it comes to trusting that 
        all that is happening in and around my life is “well with my soul.”</p>

      <p>Not surprisingly, our plans for the summer took a dramatic turn. Europe would 
        have to wait while Laura endured additional tests and procedures, including 
        painful and risky spinal taps and the collection of stem cells through pheresis. 
        Treatment included six weeks of head and spine irradiation, and four consecutive 
        rounds of inpatient, high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplants.</p>

      <p>We agreed that this challenge would be met head on, frequently irreverently, 
        often with humor, and always with unrelenting optimism.</p>

      <p>We treated every milestone of Laura’s protocol as a cause for celebration, 
        whether it was throwing a party at the salon, complete with guests, to mark the 
        occasion of Laura having her hip-length hair bobbed into a pixie cut prior to 
        radiation treatments, or celebrating the end of radiation with fireworks in our 
        cul-de-sac, or popping open a bottle of something sparkling to mark the end of 
        a round of treatment.</p>

      <p>Our family found things to celebrate and mark with gratitude throughout the 
        entire year.</p>

      <p>We also chose to incorporate holistic, natural healing strategies with the 
        mandatory cut, burn, and poison allopathy. Careful research and investigation, 
        followed by meticulous implementation helped all of us feel empowered and 
        actively part of the process.</p>

      <p>The gifts from that year have been abundant and are still revealing themselves
        to us. Laura continues to be 100% cancer-free since her surgery on May 30, 2006.</p>

      <p>The integrative practices we utilized during and after her oncology treatment 
        protected her from the aggressively toxic protocol; with the exception of some 
        mild cognitive challenges and very, very thin hair (thanks to the radiation 
        treatments) she emerged from the experience relatively unscathed and even has 
        her fertility intact. She graduated from college and is employed in her chosen 
        field.</p>

      <p>Our “cancer year” inspired me to author a book, <em>Walking on the Ceiling: 
        Reflections on Life Turned Upside Down by Pediatric Cancer</em> and to become 
        a certified holistic coach. I now help others experiencing cancer develop and 
        implement their own anticancer lifestyle.</p>

      <p>And Europe? It was still there a year later, but this time, thanks to the 
        generosity of the Make A Wish Foundation, our entire family enjoyed an enchanting, 
        life-affirming visit to Italy.</p>

      <p>All is well!</p>

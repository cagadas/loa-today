    <h6 class="h6">by Patricia Framo</h6>

    <p>Not many of us can say we were on <em>The People’s Choice Awards.</em> I didn’t 
      think I would ever be one of them either.</p>

    <p>In January 2011, I was in the middle of a divorce after 25 years of marriage. 
      At first glance one might think it was not the best time to be manifesting cool 
      things into my life, but it actually turned out to be the perfect time.</p>

    <p>The divorce was amicable, and I wished my ex-husband well, I felt so relieved 
      to be free from an unhappy marriage. Not to say there weren’t ups and downs, but 
      overall, I was flying high, open to new experiences, and looking forward to an 
      adventurous life that I could create on my own. I was in a new relationship with 
      a really nice guy and I was … well … happy.</p>

    <p>As a life transition coach for women going through divorce, empty-nesters, etc., 
      I voraciously soaked up as much as I could, as fast as I could, about the Law 
      of Attraction and how to use it in my life and work purposefully.  I employed 
      the concepts in my individual and group coaching and had recently manifested 
      spontaneously meeting Esther and Jerry Hicks (Abraham-Hicks) in a restaurant in 
      Del Mar, CA (that’s a whole other story!).</p>

    <p>So, for the most part, I was in the vortex (in a good place, connected with my 
      “higher Patty”) and feeling hopeful about my future. I put on my big-girl panties, 
      joined my first Meetup group, and started connecting more with other like-minded 
      people.</p>

    <p>One day, I got an email from someone I had only met once, asking if anyone was 
      interested in being on the red carpet at the upcoming People’s Choice Awards.  
      I replied with the requested information and included my friend Teresa as a guest, 
      thinking, <em>What the heck, I may as well go for it!</em></p>

    <p>The following week, I got an email announcing that we were accepted, with 
      instructions to follow. Well, that in itself got me pretty excited. I had no 
      clue how all of this worked, but it sounded like a fun adventure to me!</p>

    <p>We were told to wear a nice party outfit, dress as if we were going onto the 
      show, and show up very early in the morning in Los Angeles the morning of the 
      event. On the drive up from San Diego, Teresa and I stopped at a Mexican 
      restaurant in L.A., and made the bathroom our dressing room.  I can still 
      remember what that dingy bathroom looked like and what a contrast it was from 
      the glitz of the show. We got into our fancy outfits, helped each other with 
      makeup, and because it was chilly and we wanted to be comfy, threw on sweatshirts 
      and flip flops.</p>

    <p>When we got back into the car, we talked about the day ahead and got really 
      excited.</p>

    <p>I distinctly remember asserting, “Teresa, we are going to get onto the best part 
      of the red carpet. We’ll be chosen to go into the show. We will sit down in the 
      front of the theatre, surrounded by stars!”</p>

    <p>We were almost giddy in our excitement, and I felt a buzz run through my body.</p>

    <p>When we drove into the multi-level parking structure, it was very confusing and 
      chaotic with cars and people milling around and no clear direction.  We never 
      found our group, so we ended up just parking and getting in line with the first 
      group we saw.</p>

    <p>Such a wide array of people! A long process followed, and it soon became clear 
      that this was more of a casting call than anything else. The powers-that-be queued 
      us all up in various lines, stood back, evaluated and re-evaluated their choices, 
      made changes, moved people from one line to another, etc.</p>

    <p>While in the parking garage, they placed us in a line with people dressed in jeans, 
      flip flops, some looking as if they had just rolled out of bed.</p>

    <p>Teresa and I looked at each other and said, “No way are we staying in this line; 
      we need to get into the cool line so we can get into the show!”</p>

    <p>We tore off our sweatshirts, ditched our flip flops, donned our heels, and within 
      minutes, we were re-assigned to a line of women and men dressed to the nines. 
      We stayed positive and relaxed throughout, feeling the anticipation of what was 
      to come.</p>

    <p>Eventually Teresa and I ended up in the chosen line that they told us would be on 
      the best part of the red carpet, the area sponsored by CVS Pharmacy.</p>

    <p>After a long, chilly walk to the theatre along the sidewalks of South Figueroa Street, 
      our group arrived at the Staples Center. And true to their word, they sat us in the 
      best area of the outdoor red carpet, right across from where all the stars stopped 
      to be photographed.</p>

    <p>While we sat crammed side by side in bleachers, those in charge were constantly 
      moving people around to other less desirable areas of the red carpet, adding new 
      people, etc. … kind of like pawns in a chess game.  This selection process went on 
      for many hours throughout the day.</p>

    <p>There was a group of well-dressed executive-looking men and women who stood at 
      the bottom of the bleachers on the red carpet, looking at each person, whispering 
      to each other and then moving us around some more.  God forbid anyone got up to 
      use the restroom, or they’d be out, never to return! No jackets, no water, no food, 
      no bathroom runs!</p>

    <p>Eventually a couple of celebrities from E! Entertainment arrived, fashion gurus 
      Bobbie Thomas and Robert Verdi.  They explained to our group that three of us would 
      win the opportunity to go into the show with a friend, as well as valuable gift 
      cards and a bag of pricey cosmetics from CVS, and they would film the winners. 
      They practiced over and over with pretend winners, moving from place to place 
      throughout the bleachers.  All the while, the executives below observed, whispered, 
      pointed and nodded their heads, as if selecting secret agents for the CIA.</p>

    <p>At one point, Bobbie sat next to me on the bleachers, and we chatted a bit. She 
      seemed really sweet.  I kept smiling throughout the afternoon, as Teresa and I were 
      moved about within our red carpet section, no longer seated next to one another.  
      No worries! We were having fun, and it was so cool watching celebrities walking down 
      the red carpet, smiling for the paparazzi.</p>

    <p>Then it was time to announce the winners. I was feeling so calm and happy, and it 
      almost seemed natural when they pointed to me as one of the winners.  Crazy but 
      true!!</p>

    <p>Bobbie and Robert sped up the bleachers to me, gave me instructions on what to do, 
      what would happen, etc. They filmed the clip over and over, as noisy helicopters 
      hovered overhead, in an attempt to get uninterrupted video.  By the fourth time, 
      my face was aching from smiling so hard, but we finally got what they wanted.</p>

    <p>Bobby and Robert announced who I was, what I had won, and that I would be going 
      into the show.  I had no idea where that tape would be shown, but figured it would 
      be on their website or something down the line.</p>

    <p>Bobby told me that she suggested choosing me after sitting next to me earlier and 
      chatting with me. I thanked her profusely, and off we went, into the show!</p>

    <p>Teresa and I were hustled down the bleachers, with many well wishes from our red 
      carpet companions.  The woman with the headset leading us into the theatre told us 
      the show was about to start, so we needed to hurry.  We begged to stop at the 
      restroom and I never peed so fast in my life.  She briefed us on what would happen 
      next: we would enter the theatre, be seated in a group of pretend friends, and they 
      would film us all cheering as if we all had won $250 gift cards to CVS Pharmacy. 
      I actually have no idea if anyone else won this, but Teresa and I did, along with 
      an amazing bag of cosmetics, so we were happy!</p>

    <p>She rushed us through the doors and what a sight ... this huge, packed theatre 
      filled with elegant-looking people and floor-to-ceiling TV screens as the backdrop 
      of the stage.  Sparkles everywhere and search lights scanned the theatre making 
      designs across the ceiling and walls.</p>

    <p>She walked us down, down, down the aisle until we were seated in the third row, 
      maybe 20 feet from the stage.  Totally surreal! Queen Latifah was hosting, and 
      there she was, right in front of us, along with the winners, including Jennifer 
      Aniston and Neil Patrick Harris.</p>

    <p>It was a little overwhelming, and I was trying to just soak it all in, when a 
      few people said to me, “Look!  There you are on TV!”  And there I was, up on those 
      big TV screens, as they played the clip of me winning.  A camera swung around and 
      was in my face, and we waved our gift cards and cheered like crazy.  Later on, I 
      got a string of text messages from friends all over the country asking if I was 
      really on The People’s Choice Awards.  What an amazing manifestation!</p>

    <p>Some may say it’s a lucky coincidence, but I have no doubt what allowed that 
      manifestation into my experience is that I was aligned with my inner being, in 
      a positive emotional state, without resistance, and believed it could happen.  
      I asked source to make it happen, and I allowed it in.</p>

    <p>Since then, I have learned so much more about how to purposefully create my own 
      life experience.  I went from believing this process may be true, to knowing it 
      is absolutely true.  I’ve seen it over and over again in my own life and in 
      others’, including my friends, family and clients.</p>

    <p>Daily meditation, listening to Abraham-Hicks audios, being present and appreciative 
      of whatever I can, and focusing on positive aspects are the most effective ways I 
      know to allow what I want into my life.</p>

    <p>Is that the coolest thing, or what?</p>

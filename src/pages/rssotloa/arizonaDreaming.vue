    <h5 class="h5 bottom0">Arizona Dreaming</h5>
    <h6 class="h6">by Barbara Pinti</h6>

    <p>In 1995 I took a vacation right after Christmas with a friend of mine.  We spent 
      two weeks in Sedona, Arizona seeing all the sights and doing all the things that 
      tourists do.</p>

    <p>It was a wonderful two weeks.  Each day we went to one of the popular destinations 
      the area is known for, such as the Grand Canyon,  Cathedral Rock, Oak Creek Canyon, 
      and other places where we could feel the energies that abide there.</p>

    <p>One of our favorite places was Red Rock Creek.  We drove there each day, gazed at 
      the beautiful rock formations of Cathedral Rock, hiked through the creek, and smelled 
      the wonderful scent of honeysuckle from the many nearby bushes.  I took a sprig of 
      it and put it in my hair so I could smell it all day.</p>

    <p>Red Rock Creek was one of the most photographed places in the old western movies.  
      I remembered the movies I had seen as a girl, recalling Roy Rogers and especially The 
      Lone Ranger.</p>

    <p>One day, instead of continuing around the curve to go to the creek, I took a dirt 
      road straight ahead to explore the area.  I drove about a quarter of a mile and 
      stopped at a perfect view of Cathedral Rock on the left-hand side of the road.</p>

    <p>To the right I saw the most wonderful house for viewing Cathedral Rock.  I said to 
      my friend, “Now that is the house where I would love to live.  It’s just perfect!”</p>

    <p>During our two week stay, I kept getting a strong feeling that I would come back 
      to Arizona.  The longer I was there, the stronger the feeling became.  I even 
      thought about starting a business there and living there.  I took a four-seat 
      airplane ride over the area, and the sights were just breathtaking!  I truly 
      wanted to spend more time here.</p>

    <p>Before my trip to Arizona, I had a vision of a large tract of land with a barn 
      with upstairs rooms on the top floor of the barn.  I thought a lot about it as I 
      drove all over Connecticut looking for that barn, sensing I would somehow work out 
      of those rooms. Since I never found that barn, I decided it must have just been my 
      imagination.</p>

    <p>When I returned to Connecticut from Arizona, I spent a great deal of time thinking 
      about living in the southwest.  I began creating in my mind a self-made sabbatical 
      for the summer and spending it in Sedona.  I called one of the healers I visited 
      while vacationing there and inquired whether she knew anyone who could help me with 
      housing.  She gave me a name.</p>

    <p>I started saving money every week and putting it away for my sabbatical. I called 
      the woman whose name I had been given and asked her about renting a place for the 
      summer.  I told her the particulars of what I could afford and the dates of my stay.  
      She told me she would ask around and get back to me.</p>

    <p>While I awaited her response, I kept imagining spending the summer in such a magical 
      place with sunshine every day.  I was enthralled with the red rocks, seeing them in 
      my mind with the sunshine sparkling off them.</p>

    <p>Not long after that, the housing helper called and told me she had a very nice place 
      for me to rent.  She had checked off all the parameters I had given her, spoke to the 
      person who owned the apartment, and left it to us to work out the details.</p>

    <p>I was very excited and looked forward to the beginning of May when I would take what 
      I thought of as my healing journey.  The leases on both my apartment and my office were 
      up at the end of April, and the classes I taught at the local college ended May 
      9<sup>th</sup>.  Perfect timing!</p>

    <p>I put everything in storage, turned in all my students’ grades, and began what I later 
      called my “moving meditation”.  I drove to Sedona in my little red Honda Civic, windows 
      down, sun roof open, hair blowing in the wind, and loving every moment.</p>

    <p>That summer is one I will never forget. For the first time I was able to think all my 
      thoughts to completion.  I loved being by myself for the first time in many years.  I 
      listened to my favorite music and the many spiritual and holistic tapes I had collected 
      over the years.</p>

    <p>I spent nine days crossing the country so that I would be able to see the many sights 
      I had read about and so often wanted to visit. During that drive I felt as though I had 
      waited a very long time to do something this important to me.  I spent each day enjoying 
      it to the fullest.  It was a dream coming true.</p>

    <p>I arrived in Sedona early in the day and followed the directions I had been given to 
      the house I was about to rent.  I saw that I was driving on the road I had taken 
      previously to get to Red Rock Creek.</p>
    
    <p>I kept on looking at the houses, checking them against the address of the house where 
      I would stay.  Each moment of that drive became more and more exciting as I began to 
      think that the house was surely near my favorite spot in all of Sedona.</p>

    <p>As I kept driving and looking, I found my route taking me down the special road I had 
      explored during my previous visit.  My excitement was paramount now.  Could it be?  
      Could it be the house I had spotted and fallen in love with?</p>

    <p>Yes!</p>

    <p>The very same house I found during my winter vacation and designated as the “perfect” 
      place to live was the house I rented by phone, not knowing it was the same house! The 
      Law of Attraction had been hard at work bringing me everything I wanted.</p>

    <p>What a wonderful summer! I awoke every morning, hiked to Red Rock Creek, absorbing 
      the breathtaking scenery around me.</p>

    <p>Returning to Connecticut brought some confusion.  I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do or 
      where I wanted to live.  I rented some temporary office space from friends and got back 
      to work meditating on what my future held.</p>

    <p>Within a few months, I decided to open a center for alternative and complementary 
      therapies.  I found a great location for the center, then opened and filled it with 
      therapists doing different holistic modalities.</p>

    <p>It wasn’t what I had originally imagined, but it was very successful and one of the 
      first of its kind.  This kept me very busy with my own practice, managing the center 
      as a whole, and teaching college.</p>

    <p>However, there was that one niggling thought, “What about Arizona?”  I just knew there 
      was something more there for me.</p>

    <p>About a year later I returned to Arizona and began to explore the state once more.  
      I didn’t have a clear idea of what I wanted or what I was looking for.  I vaguely 
      thought about finding a ranch where I could open a residential center like the one 
      I founded in Connecticut, one where people would come and stay for several weeks at 
      a time for healing.  But I couldn’t find the right place.</p>

    <p>Feeling confused and discouraged, I returned to Connecticut and decided to put Arizona 
      out of my mind for a while.  However, it wasn’t long before I once again felt strongly 
      that I must return.</p>

    <p>An old friend who lived in Arizona gave me the name of a Realtor who might be able to 
      help me.  I really liked the first ranch he took me to, but something was holding me 
      back from signing the deal on the lease. Something wasn’t quite right.</p>

    <p>I’ve learned over the years to pay attention to those feelings and not ignore them.</p>

    <p>There were several out buildings besides the main house and barn.  I spent all day 
      checking things out.</p>

    <p>Late in the afternoon, I took my last walk around the property still undecided but 
      trying to be realistic about the fact that everything seemed to be just what I wanted.  
      I walked way out beyond the barn into the horse pastures.</p>

    <p>When I turned around and looked at the back of the barn from that angle, I saw my 
      vision!  It was the barn in the vision I had seen when I was in Connecticut.  It 
      never occurred to me that I would find it here in Arizona!</p>

    <h5 class="h5 bottom0">Getting Published</h5>
    <h6 class="h6">by Paulette Sherman</h6>

    <p>While I was in graduate school getting my doctorate, we were told that our dissertation 
      could be a literature review instead of lab research, and we could choose our topic.  
      Since my grandparents and mother were Holocaust survivors from Romania, I became 
      interested in how holocaust survivors used creativity and play to survive psychologically 
      during extreme trauma. My mom told me a story about how she made a slide out of an old 
      storm door when there was no food in the ghetto, and I wondered what similar stories 
      others had.</p>

    <p>I started reading survivor’s accounts and heard that a new Holocaust museum had opened 
      in Washington, D.C., so I made plans to visit for the day.  They had video testimonials 
      with survivor’s stories, and I spent the day watching them.</p>

    <p>During a break, I went up to the librarian, Mishlee, and mentioned that my grandfather 
      was originally from Chotin in Bessarabia and had been killed during the Holocaust.  
      I asked whether she had any photographs of him or the town.  She came back with one 
      Hebrew book, and at first I did not understand the names, nor did I know what he 
      looked like.  She helped me look for the name Avraham Wolkove, and by some miracle, 
      there he was.</p>

    <p>In those days, people took few photographs, but my grandfather had been a known speaker 
      in the town and was sitting at a meeting with several other people in the photograph.  
      She gave me a photocopy of that black and white photo in the book.</p>

    <p>This was the first time that my sister and I saw our grandfather.  My mom also did not 
      know what he looked like because she had been two years old at the time of his death.  
      In my heart I had wanted to find that picture, but I had not planned it, and this 
      missing piece of our family puzzle seemed to fall magically into place.</p>

    <p>After graduate school, I knew that I’d like to write a book and maybe a column.  One 
      day I picked up a free magazine, called <em>The Improper Magazine,</em> from a kiosk 
      on the street in Manhattan.  I looked at the masthead and had the thought to email 
      the editor Keith Girard to ask to write a column.  I had not written a column before 
      and did not have much writing experience, but this limitation did not occur to me at 
      that time, so I just did it. He wrote back and said he’d be glad for me to write a 
      monthly column on relationships, which I then did for two years until the print magazine 
      went digital.</p>

    <p>At the time I was dating, hoping to meet find a husband while working as a therapist and 
      wishing I would publish my first book before I married.  I took notes on what I learned 
      in my own dating process and subsequently developed a manual for a dating class I 
      facilitated for single clients.</p>

    <p>I went into a Barnes and Noble to look through a <em>Writers Market</em> book and jotted 
      down the contact information of four publishers on an envelope.  Then I sent in my dating 
      manual via snail mail with my resume.  I got calls back from two editors, both of whom told 
      me it was something they’d been looking for.</p>

    <p>One editor submitted it to the editorial board review, but they passed on it.  The other 
      editor was Cynthia Black, who was also the publisher of <em>Beyond Words,</em> which formed 
      an imprint called Atria Books with Simon and Schuster.</p>

    <p>I did not know that at the time, nor did I know that she was in the process of publishing 
      the book, The Secret, and was looking for other books on the Law of Attraction. My dating 
      book was about the Law of Attraction, but that term was not in the subtitle until she added 
      it, and it was not mentioned in the book.  She suggested that we go back and forth with 
      rewrites, and if she was satisfied with the final book then she’d offer me a contract.</p>

    <p>I signed the publishing contract right before I got married.  What were the chances of 
      getting my first deal with Simon and Schuster without an agent and with little writing 
      experience (except for a column), and then sending it to the person working on that topic?  
      It was not something I could have planned consciously.</p>

    <p>After the book got published, I married, and we later had two kids.  I had little time for 
      writing then and had to focus on more practical things.</p>

    <p>At age 41, I was diagnosed with breast cancer.  I walked on the beach and prayed and asked 
      whether I was going to die.  I heard that I would not and that I had a legacy of at least 
      22 books left to write.  I went through chemotherapy and radiation for a year and lost all 
      my hair.  I continued working as a therapist and wrote on the subway and in the hospital. 
      The idea of 22 books seemed crazy to my conscious mind, but my spirit accepted it as a 
      clear command, so I just went to work, learning self-publishing.</p>

    <p>I was on a mission to write these books, but didn’t want to go into any debt in the process, 
      since our kids were our practical priority.  My desire was to have those self-published 
      books paid for even if I did not make a profit.  I did not have many book sales and had no 
      energy or budget for marketing at the time and had not yet worked on much of a social media 
      platform.  My goal was to get my messages of love out there and to put my books in hope 
      chests for my kids as a legacy, which I did.  I trusted it would all work out, even if I 
      didn’t know how.</p>

    <p>I happened upon a blog by Gordon Burgett who writes about self-publishing where he said that 
      he made more money by getting a foreign agent and translating his self-published books into 
      a few languages than he did with a traditional American publishing deal.  I didn’t know 
      anything about this, so I searched the term foreign literary agent in Linked In, and a woman 
      named Marleen Seegers came up.</p>

    <p>She looked beautiful and smart, and her agency looked new.  This was the first and only 
      foreign agent that I wrote at that time. She liked my book, When Mars Women Date: <em>How 
      Career Women Can Love Themselves into the Relationship of their Dreams,</em> and it 
      subsequently got published into Chinese, Korean and Czech.  The sales more than covered 
      my basic publishing expenses for my ongoing book legacy</p>

    <p>Later, another foreign agent from Linkedin helped me to publish two other books I wrote 
      into Chinese.   I later read a publishing book by an expert who said that one of the main 
      reasons to get a traditional publisher is they have a much better chance to sell your 
      translation rights, but I hadn’t known that or adopted that limiting belief.</p>

    <p>As I wrote and worked on my self-care, I started to take sacred baths where I would have 
      silence in the morning to align my thoughts and feelings with my intention and goals.  
      I’d relax, pray, meditate, and receive guidance. In this way I got many creative ideas 
      for my books, and they flowed out of me. I published them one after another (literally) 
      on Amazon and soon had 20 published books just five years after my diagnosis.</p>

    <p> I was doing well emotionally, physically, and spiritually and felt that this morning 
      bathing ritual could be helpful to others. So I wrote a small book about it.  I had 
      given my Reiki teacher, Raven Keyes, several of my books as gifts. She had never said 
      anything about them, but for some reason when I handed her book number 21 (which was 
      about using different sacred bath rituals to improve your love life), Raven said that 
      she loved the idea and encouraged me to create bath rituals in many other life areas 
      as well.  She said she’d never done this, but she thought her editor at Llewellyn might 
      consider the book a good fit.</p>

    <p>So, I submitted a proposal and several chapters. Llewellyn came back with a publishing 
      contract.  This felt like a miracle to me because of the ease with which it happened.  
      My latest book, The Book of Sacred Baths, came out last year, and now I am writing book 
      number 22 in my legacy project.</p>

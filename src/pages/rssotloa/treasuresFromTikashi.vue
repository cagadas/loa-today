    <h6 class="h6">by Renate Donnovan</h6>

    <p>I lived in a shared accommodation. It was a cute, rented duplex with plush 
      off-white rugs and rustic wood trim on the doors and ceilings. I shared this 
      space with two roommates.</p>

    <p>All three of us were going through divorces or some version of massive 
      “life-restructuring.” These restructurings took the forms of career changes, 
      recovery from financial losses, and ending relationships.</p>

    <p>One of my roommates was a drug addict who created chaos in the house through 
      both a remarkable lack of hygiene (personal and home) and through the unpredictable, 
      Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde behavior he displayed depending on his level of drug-induced 
      high or withdrawal.</p>

    <p>We had a controlling, prying, noisy landlord who attempted regularly to bypass 
      the landlord-tenant laws in every way from unannounced, surprise visits, to using 
      the garage we were renting for his own purposes, to spying on us by looking in our 
      windows, to holding yard sales on our property without asking or notifying us.</p>

    <p>One day, my already frayed nerves encountered more than I could manage.</p>

    <p>My stoned roommate blared heavy metal music while dancing around the house in his 
      underwear screaming lyrics at the top of his lungs.</p>

    <p>Our landlord worked in “our” detached-garage while peering into our house windows 
      through a pair of binoculars.</p>

    <p>I attempted to deal with legal needs created by my “life-restructuring,” failing 
      miserably.  I felt frantic. I needed peace. I needed an escape.</p>

    <p>Despite the drizzling, cold late-March rain, I bundled up in rubber boots, a 
      rain-slicker, and gloves.  Pulling the hood of the slicker over my head, I bolted 
      out the front door like a house cat making a desperate play for freedom and went 
      for a walk.</p>

    <p>Walking usually has a therapeutic quality for me, but on the day in question I was 
      stirred up … not just because of my roommate and landlord, but from the personal 
      archaeological unearthing that deep inner work and personal growth create.</p>

    <p>I was enrolled in a personal growth program that would last several years. I was 
      trying to reconcile concepts of the Law of Attraction with my current reality.</p>

    <p>I was also reading Maximum Achievement: <em>Strategies and Skills that Will Unlock 
      Your Hidden Powers to Succeed,</em> by Brian Tracy.</p>

    <p>My heart was heavy, and my thoughts were disjointed. One minute my mind replayed 
      the antics of roommate and landlord, the next minute it practiced Brian’s technique, 
      then it swung between thinking about what I didn’t want and what I did want, then 
      back to my roommate, and so on.</p>

    <p>Somewhere in that swirling shamble, an inner voice said, “I would really like to 
      own my own home. Is that possible? What would have to happen to make it possible?”</p>

    <p>The thought had barely registered when I spotted an odd purple square on the sodden 
      ground, partially tucked into the winter grass. Enough of it was visible to display 
      the words, “Treasures from Tikashi.”</p>

    <p>I recognized the purple square as one of those inspirational/spiritual cards that 
       reader can use as a personal motivator, provoking insights for daily guidance.</p>

    <p>The card was soaked through, wrinkled, puckered, and darkly stained in one corner. 
      It had obviously been there for some time.</p>

    <p>The strangeness of it stopped me. There were no other cards or objects anywhere 
      around. Knowing how valuable these types of cards are to those of us who have them, 
      it seemed wrong to leave it lying there, abandoned. I took my right glove off and 
      carefully (to ensure I didn’t rip it) lifted the card and turned it over. The face 
      of the card read:</p>

    <hr class="hr" />

    <h5 style="color: lime;">ABUNDANCE</h5>

    <p class="signature" style="text-align:center; color: lime;">Love, security, freedom, happiness, 
      support and finance are yours in abundance. The universe provides, it is up to you 
      to say ‘Yes!’</p>

    <p class="signature" style="text-align:center; color: lime;">All life flows with love, and you are 
      an energy being of love, you are not separate from what you desire. Let go of limited 
      expectations and acknowledge that you are worthy of all things.</p>

    <p class="signature" style="text-align:center; color: lime;">Participate in life’s joy and you shall 
      receive the rewards of your efforts.</p>

    <hr class="hr" />

    <p>The rain changed from drizzle to downpour as I stood there blinking, awe struck, for 
      a full five minutes as the synchronicity of the situation sunk in. Then, with a squeal, 
      I jumped for joy.</p>

    <p>Rarely, before or since, have I received such a clear answer. With a combination of 
      irrational joy and expectation, my feet carried me back to my shared accommodations.</p>

    <p>Later that night, my mother called me. She worried about my living situation and 
      wondered what the current housing prices were in Calgary. How much would I need for 
      a down payment? She only had “this amount” that she could spare – would that be enough? 
      Could I manage the mortgage payments? We talked for several hours about my options.</p>

    <p>The first night I slept in my new condo was June 21st – the Summer Solstice, the 
      longest day of the year, exactly three months to the day after I found the Abundance 
      Card on the day of the Spring Equinox.</p>

    <p>I sent an email to the contact address on Brain Tracy’s website. I’m not sure why; 
      I just wanted to share with him the impact his work had made on my life.</p>

    <p>I wrote that when I started reading his book, like so many of the people he wrote 
      about, I thought to myself, “I’m not special. Can I really do this?”</p>

    <p>And, like the people in the stories he shared, I put aside my fears and used his 
      Law of Attraction technique.</p>

    <p>I assumed one of the staff who monitored the email would read it. I simply hoped 
      the person who read it would pass along my appreciation to Brian.</p>

    <p>The response to my note was simple. The email contained one line, “Congratulations 
      on discovering you are one of the special people.  &mdash;<em>Brian Tracy</em>”.</p>

    <h5 class="h5 bottom0">Markus</h5>
    <h6 class="h6">by Joel Elston</h6>

    <p>A few years ago, I received a call from a foster care caseworker. She explained 
      that she had been given my phone number by a colleague who thought I could help one 
      of the kids on her caseload.</p>

    <p>Since Medicaid doesn’t pay for life coaching (foster care kids have Medicaid), her 
      request began with the explanation that my services would need to be <em>pro bono.</em></p>

    <p>I agreed to hear the details and then decide what course of action to suggest.</p>

    <p>She said that Markus was 12 years old. He was placed in foster care when he was 8 
      due to his mother being sent to prison for drug distribution. She died a few months 
      into her four year sentence. Markus had no relatives that were able to take custody 
      or even provide minimum emotional support.</p>

    <p>Markus had been in multiple placements during his time in foster care: group homes, 
      therapeutic foster care homes, and regular foster care homes. At that time he lived 
      with a single foster parent with two other boys in the home. The foster mom had asked 
      for Markus to be moved to another home, mainly due to his defiance.</p>

    <p>His grades were all F’s when he would bother to take tests. He would not read the 
      question and often drew inappropriate drawings in the answer section. He was frequently 
      suspended, both in-school suspensions and out. He was on nine different psychotropic 
      medications to treat several mental health diagnoses. He has seen multiple counselors 
      and therapists, but none could get him to participate.</p>

    <p>The case worker said there was something about this particular kid that got to her. 
      He really had been dealt a bad hand. After hearing the details of Markus’ case, I 
      agreed to meet with him to see if I could help.</p>

    <p>For our first meeting, I met Markus at my office. I put my hand out to shake his and 
      said, “Markus, I’m Joel. It’s good to meet you.”</p>

    <p>He put his tiny hand out and lightly shook my hand. He said, “Good to meet you.”</p>

    <p>His voice seemed to be closer to that of a five-year-old than a 12-year-old. After 
      he sat down, he was not able to look me in the eye for long. He moved his legs back 
      and forth, his feet not touching the ground.</p>

    <p>“Markus, tell me about yourself,” is how I began our session.</p>

    <p>“I am oppositionally defiant. I am depressed and have ADHD,” was his response.</p>

    <p>I smiled and said, “No, tell me about you, what do you like to do?”</p>

    <p>“I don’t know,” he replied.</p>

    <p>When I asked which medications he was on, he seemed pleased since he knew the answer. 
      “Prozac, Ritalin, Tegretol, and Remeron are the ones I know. There are some others, 
      but I forget what they are,” he answered.</p>

    <p>“Do you know why you are on those?” I questioned.</p>

    <p>“The Prozac is for depression,” he responded.</p>

    <p>Before he could go on to the next drug, I asked him if he was depressed.</p>

    <p>He said, “Yes, I think.”</p>

    <p>“Do you know what depression is?” I asked.</p>

    <p>“It means you are sad,” he said, looking at the floor.</p>

    <p>“Being sad can be a part of depression, but being sad doesn’t 
      always mean you are depressed. Do you have a reason, or reasons, 
      to be sad?” I asked.</p>

    <p>“Well, I am in foster care, and my mom died. Nobody cares about me. I’m stupid 
      and will always be a fuck-up. Are those reasons to be sad?” he answered in a 
      cross between a mocking and angry tone.</p>

    <p>“Yep, I would be sad, too. There is one thing you said that I know for sure is 
      not true. You are not stupid. In fact, you are very smart,” I said with confidence.</p>

    <p>“That’s not what my teachers say,” he quipped.</p>

    <p>“FUCK THEM,” I said with a deep bass in my voice.</p>

    <p>“Can you say that?” he asked with a shocked look in his eyes.</p>

    <p>“I can say what I want, especially when it is the truth,” I answered.</p>

    <p>He smiled at the fact that I had used such strong language. I could tell he was 
      starting to invest in our session emotionally.</p>

    <p>I began explaining to Markus the concept of negative inner dialogue and the role 
      it plays in our reality. Markus had many people telling him what was wrong with him, 
      and as any kid would do he believed them. Doctors, counselors, and parental figures 
      had all told Markus how bad or disordered he was.</p>

    <p>I explained to him that he was behaving defiantly and that some one had labeled 
      him as having, “Oppositional Defiant Disorder,” a condition listed in the Diagnostic 
      and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV).</p>

    <p>He had created his inner dialogue based on what he heard and observed. He basically 
      had become what they had told him he was. After I explained my theory to him, I could 
      tell he was buying it with a little skepticism.</p>

    <p>“What if everything I told you was true, and you created this obnoxious version of 
      yourself because you were given false information about yourself?” I asked.</p>

    <p>“What about all the damn medication I’m taking? That’s for real stuff,” he argued.</p>

    <p>“Let’s look at your medication. The first one you said you were on was Prozac. It is 
      for depression, right? You said you thought depression is about being sad. Does it help 
      you to not be sad?” I asked.</p>

    <p>“No,” he quickly answered.</p>

    <p>“You said your Mom died, and you are in foster care. I think anyone would be sad if 
      those things happened, right?” I asked him.</p>

    <p>“Yes,” he conceded.</p>

    <p>“Does Prozac in any way help your Mom not be dead or get you out of foster care?” 
      I asked.</p>

    <p>“No, it doesn’t,” he said, with a bass and power in his voice that wasn’t there before.</p>

    <p>I spent the rest of our session explaining to Markus how he is in charge of his own 
      happiness, how his thoughts create his reality, and more details about the Law of 
      Attraction.</p>

    <p>I gave him a copy of the book, <em>The Secret,</em> by Rhonda Byrne and asked him 
      to call me when he wanted to meet again, but only after he read the book. He told me 
      he would read it. We stood up, and I was caught off guard seeing tears in is eyes as 
      we shook hands.</p>

    <p>The next day I had a message on my voicemail from Markus’ caseworker asking me to call 
      her back. When I returned the call, she was excited. Markus went home after our session 
      and told his foster mom that he was misdiagnosed with Oppositional Defiant Disorder and 
      he would no longer be giving her a hard time. He apologized to her for his past behavior 
      and thanked her for taking care of him. The foster mom said he was a different kid the 
      rest of the day.</p>

    <p>He got up the next morning without prompting and got dressed for school with no arguing. 
      On the way out the door, he asked his foster mom to get him an appointment with his 
      psychiatrist, saying he needed to discuss his medications.</p>

    <p>The case worker was shocked.</p>

    <p>“He has never listened to any counselor before. What did you tell him that reached him?” 
      she asked.</p>

    <p>“The truth,” I replied.</p>

    <p>A few days later I got a call from Markus’ foster mom. She reinforced what the case worker 
      had reported and said his remarkable change continued.</p>

    <p>She also reported that Markus’ teacher called her to let her know Markus apologized for 
      his past behavior. He committed to work hard in her class. He even asked to be moved to 
      the front of the class to avoid distractions.</p>

    <p>She also asked if I would go to Markus’ psychiatric appointment with him the following 
      week. She was worried that the psychiatrist would not listen to what he had to say. 
      I agreed to go.</p>

    <p>I met Markus and his foster mom outside of the psychiatrist’s office. I asked him, 
      “Are you nervous?”</p>

    <p>“Not a bit,” he responded with confidence.</p>

    <p>After a 30-minute wait to see the psychiatrist, Markus and I stepped into his 
      consulting room. The psychiatrist asked who I was several times and asked Markus 
      if he wanted me in the appointment.</p>

    <p>Markus looked him in the eye and said, “I asked him to be here.” He had a resolve 
      I didn’t know he possessed.</p>

    <p>The psychiatrist began to speak, and Markus interrupted, “How does Prozac help with 
      my mom dying? How did you determine I needed 80 mgs of Ritalin? Where is the evaluation 
      that shows I have ADHD?”</p>

    <p>Markus was relentless but remained in control. He clearly had researched each 
      medication. The psychiatrist tried to answer along the way, but Markus kept asking 
      medication questions. It was clear the psychiatrist was frustrated and no match for 
      this amazing kid.</p>

    <p>“I want to get off all this crap as quickly as possible,” Markus demanded.</p>

    <p>The psychiatrist was clearly angry but agreed. When he handed Markus his new 
      prescriptions, Markus asked me, “Will you help me find a new doctor?” I nodded 
      in agreement.</p>

    <p>In the parking lot I told Markus that I was impressed with what I saw. I reminded 
      him of his power over his perspective, saying his new perspective should include 
      seeing himself as powerful, resilient, and brilliant. He gave me a hug.</p>

    <p>His foster mom hugged me and then hugged Markus. She told him, “I have never been 
      more proud of anyone than I am of you. I have never seen anyone make such a positive 
      change so quickly. You make me want to be a better person.”</p>

    <p>Markus told her, “Let’s help each other.”</p>

    <p>I had several more sessions with Markus, and his change was amazing. His new 
      attitude caused others to change their attitudes toward him.</p>

    <p>His teacher became his biggest advocate and worked with him to catch him up. He 
      went from all F’s to the A/B Honor Roll. Markus started to love school, and he 
      continues to thrive in the educational environment. His only medication is a small 
      dose of Ritalin to help him focus. He only takes it on school days.</p>

    <p>A few months ago, I had a call from Markus. He was joyful as he yelled, “I’m 
      getting adopted!” A family had been identified as an adoptive placement.</p>

    <p>Markus is now 14-years-old and living with his new family. His adoption hearing 
      will occur sometime in March 2018. I will be there!</p>

    <p>A young man changed his entire world for the better by simply changing his 
      perspective. The Law of Attraction is always at work. Knowing how to use it to 
      your advantage is the key. Younger people actually respond better than older people 
      to this message because they have less negative baggage to release.</p>

    <p>The Law of Attraction cannot change the past, but understanding it can change 
      your perspective of the past. Markus decided he was no longer going to be a victim 
      of his past. He chose to be strengthened by his experience instead of defeated by 
      it. He realized that he, and he alone, was in charge of how he viewed the past. We 
      each have this amazing power.</p>

    <p>Markus recently told me he wants to be a psychiatrist who uses Law of Attraction 
      concepts in his practice. Trust me: if this kid wants it to happen, it will happen.</p>

    <hr />

    <p>Markus’ story is based on a real case. However, Markus is not his real name, and 
      other details have been altered to protect his confidentiality. One day this 
      outstanding young man will let the world know who he is and share even more 
      details of his amazing story.</p>

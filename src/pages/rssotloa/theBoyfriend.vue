    <h5 class="h5 bottom0">The Boyfriend</h5>
    <h6 class="h6">by Ana Hernando</h6>

    <p>I was sitting in my office working. My 16-year-old daughter came in crying.</p>

    <p>“I don’t understand! Why is it that when Johnathan was my boyfriend he never 
      took me out, and now that Sarah is dating him, he is treating her like a queen? 
      She isn’t prettier than me. She isn’t smarter than me. She plays like she’s a 
      ditz. What is it about me? I don’t get it! What’s wrong with me?”</p>

    <p>I desperately wanted to ease my daughter’s pain, but I also knew that this was 
      a chance for me to empower her and show her just how amazing and potent she is.</p>

    <p>I wiped her tears and softly spoke. “Who do these tears belong to? Are you not 
      a child of the most high God? Do you think you are unequipped to create the life 
      you desire? Do you honestly believe that you are not enough?  Are you an infinite 
      being?”</p>

    <p>“Mom!”</p>

    <p>“Well, are you?”</p>

    <p>“Yes, Mom”,  sounding congested while wiping her eyes.</p>

    <p>“And as such, you know that whatever you ask for with gratitude in your heart 
      and knowing, you will receive?”</p>

    <p>“Yes, but, it doesn’t feel that way. I ask, and I ask, and I ask even more. 
      And NOTHING!”</p>

    <p>“Sweet One, when our words ask one thing and our mind and beliefs ask another, 
      there is confusion and we get a mixed-up version of what we asked for.  We must 
      get extremely clear in our asking. It’s kind of like the movie Weird Science. 
      Remember? The two boys created this woman, every specific detail of her. 
      And ****POOF**** she appeared.</p>

    <p>“Go get a piece of paper and a pen.”</p>

    <p>She looked at me perplexed, then went up to her room.  I could hear her moving 
      stuff around; her room was typically disorganized but not dirty.</p>

    <p>“Got it, Mom, but I don’t see how goal-setting is going to *poof* my perfect
      boyfriend to appear.”</p>

    <p>She knew that writing goals is what I coach my clients to do. She stood at the 
      top of the stairs, pen and paper in hand.</p>

    <p>“With each step down the stairs, clear your mind.  Stop thinking. Each time 
      you take a step down towards me,  get into your body and become aware of the 
      feelings you will have when you are in the relationship of your dreams.”</p>

    <p>Rolling her eyes, embarrassed, she took a step down.</p>

    <p>“I know this seems weird, but trust me.”</p>

    <p>Once she reached the bottom step, we sat at the table. I picked up the remote 
      to turn on some music and asked her, “What kind of music does your ideal boyfriend 
      like?”</p>

    <p>She played the music from her Spotify account.</p>

    <p>“On your paper, you are going to write a list of the desired features for your 
      boyfriend. Be very specific.</p>

    <p>“Do not write ‘tall’. Write how tall: ‘minimum height of 5’9”.</p>

    <p>“Do not write ‘smart’. Write ‘scores in the top percent of his class. Is witty 
      and can think on his feet.’</p>

    <p>“Do not write ‘is rich’. Write ‘has a positive relationship with money’.</p>

    <p>“These are examples.  Ask yourself what color are his eyes? What color is his 
      hair? How long/short? What about his nose? Hands? Feet? Build? Teeth? What does 
      he like to do? Hobbies? How often? What are his characteristics? Humorous? Honors 
      his family? Self-confidence? Self-Worth? How does he make you feel?  Where do you 
      go on dates? What are his ambitions?</p>

    <p>“Once you have his picture in your mind and you can feel the energy of him, write 
      your list.  Read over your list in the morning when you get ready for school. Read 
      over your list right before you go to bed.  When you read the list, picture all of 
      it and feel the vibration of the relationship and the person.”</p>

    <p>She wrote out her list. She put it up on her vanity mirror and reviewed it just 
      as I said.</p>

    <p>“Mom, I met this guy named Jake, but he’s a little short.”</p>

    <p>“Go back to your list. Does Jake fit everything on your list? Does he make you 
      feel like the person on your list? You put your order in. If what you asked for 
      comes out wrong, don’t settle. Send it back with a grateful heart, and be patient.”</p>

    <p>A month went by. My daughter came to me again.</p>

    <p>“Mom! I met this boy named Grant. Guess what? He is the boy on my list!!”</p>

    <p>She has been dating Grant for over a year. Now she understands how the Law of 
      Attraction works. Getting very specific, visualizing, writing it down, reviewing 
      it daily ... all of these work together to create neuro-synapses in the brain, 
      electrical impulses, vibrating molecules, radiating through the universe 
      attracting similar vibrations.</p>

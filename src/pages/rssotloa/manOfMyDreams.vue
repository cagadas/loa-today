    <h6 class="h6">by Hannah Golightly</h6>

    <p>For the past five years I have been pretty much desperate for a boyfriend. 
      It's a bit embarrassing to admit, but it's true! I wasn't just desperate for 
      any old boyfriend though. It had to be the right one. I was obsessed with 
      finding him and bored my friends by constantly talking about dating all the 
      time.</p>

    <p>I signed up for all kinds of dating apps and sites. I had the occasional 
      fling with completely unsuitable men. I briefly dated an abusive partner 
      who cheated on me, was violent, spread malicious lies, and carried out a 
      narcissistic smear campaign about me in my home town, while I tried not 
      to give up hope.</p>

    <p>Being in my mid-thirties with most of my childhood friends flaunting their 
      marriages, babies, and children on Facebook day in and day out, it was hard 
      at times. I felt left behind, rejected, left on the shelf. I didn't feel like 
      it was going to happen for me.</p>

    <p>I tried to lower my expectations after years and years of refining what I 
      was looking for in a man down to specific details. I began just wishing for 
      a man who didn't abuse me or hit me. I guess I thought that was more achievable 
      considering that I believed that all the good men were married or taken by 
      the time they were my age.</p>

    <p>Dating sites were full of men with very obvious issues. I spent hours and 
      hours trawling them looking for someone special, someone unique, a good match 
      for me.</p>

    <p>I am pretty unconventional in style, approach to life, music taste, and clothes. 
      I started feeling like I would be better able to attract a man if I looked more 
      normal or more mainstream. I mean, I thought I was cool … but I wasn't surrounded 
      by any men who appreciated me the way I was.</p>

    <p>My recent short-lived abusive relationship was with a man who wanted me to 
      completely change the way I dressed! I didn't give in, but it did make me 
      wonder if I was missing out on love because I was “different” in my dress 
      sense. But I have a fashion degree, and I firmly believed that my dress 
      sense was part and parcel of “the point” of a guy getting together with me. 
      I'd suit someone a bit less conventional and that was what would make me 
      special to the right man. But my faith got tested over and over again with 
      loneliness and failed attempts to get with men from dating sites.</p>

    <p>I started to see that when things manifest in our lives, they often ease 
      their way into our experience gradually. All the men I dated in the last 
      year leading up to finding the love of my life prepared the way in some 
      respect. They each got me used to the idea of a man who shared qualities 
      that my partner now has. In meeting each one, I sort of leveled up my 
      expectations about what I could expect in a partner.</p>

    <p>I mostly dated wealthy men for the first time in my life. Meeting them 
      online, I had no clue to their wealth. Previously, I had dated men who 
      sponged off me, and I paid rent for four of my ex boyfriends! I started 
      to expand my idea about getting comfortable with a man who had money and 
      would have a lot to offer me in terms of being a provider. I didn't actually 
      get together with any of these men, but they had this impact on my mindset.</p>

    <p>I had previously in my twenties written lists of qualities I was looking 
      for in a partner and had boyfriends with those exact qualities manifested 
      in my life. As the year wore on, I grew more and more disappointed with my 
      dating experiences and lack of success. I would meet men, we would get on, 
      and then after two dates or a couple of weeks, they would disappear or show 
      their true (unpleasant) colours while I ran for the hills.</p>

    <p>I wrote another list of qualities for my ideal partner at the end of 2016. 
      I deleted it some time in 2017 from my phone. I realised that whenever I 
      manifested a man to order like that, there was always some catch, something 
      I had overlooked. They didn't make me happy, and it didn't last.</p>

    <p>I persevered through terrible dating experience after terrible dating 
      experience. Being often housebound due to a health condition, I saw online 
      dating as my most likely way to meet a partner, but in all honesty, I didn't 
      truly want a love story that started with meeting on a dating site. I think 
      that's why in spite of being addicted to trawling them, I didn't meet anyone 
      on there worth dating.</p>

    <p>I even had some very scary experiences including a stalker and someone who 
      spat in my mouth! The final straw came when a guy put his hands around my 
      neck repeatedly on the first date, in the street, just a couple of hours 
      after I had met him! I told him I didn't like it, but he kept doing it. 
      That's the point where I just took the hint and deleted my dating accounts! 
      The Universe was clearly steering me away from them!</p>

    <p>After that, I completely gave up on men. I asked myself: do I even wanted 
      a boyfriend after all? I mean, most of my exes in my twenties had been abusive, 
      and dating had become scary and dangerous. What was the point?</p>

    <p>As many people know, depression can be triggered by giving up on a dream. 
      I gave up on love and men. I got very very down in the dumps and barely left 
      my house for about two months. I started to feel like I was literally going 
      to die from loneliness.</p>

    <p>My parents have a happy marriage and are still best friends forty years later. 
      Growing up, I didn't really perceive them as being in love, because it wasn't 
      like love in Hollywood films or on TV. My mother always told me she "married her 
      best friend," which didn't sound very romantic to me at the time. It took me 
      many years to see what they shared together clearly and to understand that what 
      they had was true love, what people should aim for in their life partnerships.</p>

    <p>I used to love the story my dad told about how they got together. They met in 
      Greece in the seventies while traveling, before this became a commonplace thing 
      to do. They discovered after getting together that my dad had actually visited 
      my mother's hometown before they met, meeting her dad in the shop her family 
      owned. I always found that magical to hear! I started to want that sort of thing 
      for myself, an epic love story rather than a convenient online dating boyfriend 
      experience.</p>

    <p>I came to terms with the fact that actually, no, I didn't know what I wanted in 
      a partner because whenever I had manifested from a list of desired qualities, 
      these men had arrived in my life and not made me happy. I usually ask the Universe 
      for the things I want to manifest. But on this occasion it resonated with me more 
      to ask God. So one day, I just asked God to "send me the perfect partner for a 
      soulmate relationship and send me signs so I know it's him."</p>

    <p>As I said that, I pictured my dad walking into my mum's shop and meeting her 
      dad long before they met in another country. To me, that was how I pictured a sign.</p>

    <p>Suddenly one day out of the blue, I was scrolling on Facebook and saw the friend 
      request icon appear. <em>Who is the Universe sending me now?</em> I have no idea 
      why I asked this. I often get random friend requests from strangers or people I 
      just met and don't even think anything of it. But I felt at that moment connected 
      to the Universe and open to its messages for some unknown reason.</p>

    <p>It turned out to be David, my ex-boyfriend from when I was a teenager. I wasn't 
      too excited to speak to him as he had asked me out in 2011 and then stood me up. 
      But I didn't mind adding him again, so I did. I just wasn't that bothered either 
      way.</p>

    <p>By this time I was really low. I usually think positively and upbeat and don't 
      often suffer low feelings or moods. But I wasn't myself, so I chatted to David but 
      wasn't as friendly as I would usually have been.</p>

    <p>I'm pretty blunt and open. So when David asked me how I was, I told him, "Right 
      now I feel suicidal." I wasn't in any danger of acting on these feelings, but I 
      just answered honestly about how I felt. He told me that he was feeling the same 
      way. This worried me, and I encouraged him to talk. I listened to him and did 
      what I could to support him and help him feel better.</p>

    <p>I somehow persuaded him to come over to my house a few days later. Both of us 
      were in a bad way. I hadn't showered for days, and my hair was a mess. I had no 
      makeup on, and I wasn't dressed. His eyes were dark, and he was very guarded. He 
      had a dark aura about him. He sat on the end of my bed and poured his heart out 
      to me, telling me things he had never told anyone before. I listened and listened.</p>

    <p>Eventually, he was about to leave, and I asked him for a cuddle. He gave me a 
      really awkward cuddle at first. I was quite concerned for him as he was so low 
      in himself. Then we lay down together, and we held each other tightly for the 
      first time. I felt like I had never been so emotionally close to anyone in my 
      whole life! It was by far the most intense hug I have ever experienced. It was 
      genuinely life changing.</p>

    <p>As we held each other tightly, both feeling the same thing, my heart spoke up. 
      It said directly, telepathically to David's heart the words, "I love you." 
      My ego mind kicked right in to protest! Thoughts like <em>Don't be ridiculous! 
      Of course you don't!</em> occurred, but my heart was sure.</p>

    <p>It was really weird, because I didn't feel that chemical high that I had 
      previously associated with love. It was a calm knowing feeling from my heart 
      to his. It had nothing to do with my mind or opinions.</p>

    <p>David later told me that I saved his life.</p>

    <p>As the weeks went on, we spent more and more time on the phone and at my house 
      together, reconnecting and getting to know each other again. Over time it became 
      more and more clear that there was something very special between us. There were 
      all these signs and synchronicities!</p>

    <p>We discovered that we had a matching scar on our chins.</p>

    <p>We finally saw significance in the fact that he had spent so much time in my 
      village as a teenager (before meeting me in a nearby town and dating me for 
      about a month), even though he lived about 30 miles away. He had visited my 
      mother's home town in a foreign country, just like my dad had done!</p>

    <p>Even though he lived about 30 miles away, he had visited my mother's home 
      town in a foreign country.</p>

    <p>He had a son born on my birthday. It blew my mind!</p>

    <p>We fell deeply in love, in a way that neither of us had come close to 
      experiencing before. As time goes on we continue to discover more layers 
      to our compatibility and see more signs and synchronicities that tell us 
      we are meant to be together. We have the same dream lifestyle that we are 
      working towards living together.</p>

    <p>It dawned on me that he is the man two psychics predicted that I would 
      end up with. Laul Richardson gave me a reading recently and told me I would 
      get with “a man who I had already met,” telling me he was a chef. After we 
      got together, David decided to change careers and become a chef, with no 
      prompting from me!</p>

    <p>She also told me that we would “live an alternative lifestyle,” and we are 
      doing just that, planning our eco house that we both dreamed of living in 
      and building before we got together.</p>

    <p>Last summer for my birthday, so many people who came for my night out 
      were called Dave or David that we actually nicknamed everyone Dave for 
      the evening, even the girls!</p>

    <p>I also spent a lot of time with two of my best male friends, both called 
      Dave, in 2017. Now I know this was the Universe preparing me for David to 
      come into my life. I love how it does that!</p>

    <p>He is everything I could ever wish for in a partner and so much more. 
      I am so glad I asked God to pick me my partner because he picked me someone 
      far better than I would have dared to dream of.</p>

    <p>David loves the same things as I do, prefers an alternative lifestyle, 
      likes a lot of the same music and fashion, and enjoys a lot of the same 
      food. We have so much fun and laughter together. We seem to be compatible 
      in every way possible.</p>

    <p>His family loves me, and I love them as well. He's more than a dream come 
      true, and vice-versa. He treats me like a queen, and I treat him like a king.</p>

    <p>He is my ultimate partner, and even though we had to wait 20 years to be 
      together, it was worth it for what we have together now. He taught me to 
      dream bigger and to believe in love.</p>

    <p>Neither of us have ever been happier!</p>

    <p>Follow your heart and you will find yourself happy.</p>

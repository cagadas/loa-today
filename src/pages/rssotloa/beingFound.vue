    <h6 class="h6">by Walt Thiessen</h6>

    <p>During the first 40 years of my life, I was less than successful when it came to 
      the opposite sex.</p>

    <p>That's putting it mildly!</p>

    <p>n truth, I had not had a single successful relationship in all my years that lasted 
      more than one month. One month! On numerous occasions I asked friends and family to 
      please explain women to me using small words, short sentences, and illustrative 
      diagrams. I was that confused.</p>

    <p>After 22 years as a legal adult, I was so depressed and so discouraged that I was 
      ready to just give up. I could not see any way around this seemingly insurmountable 
      problem.</p>

    <p>It's not like I hadn't taken any steps to try to improve my situation over the years. 
      I had signed up for dating services and even started a dating newsletter, a singles 
      dance with a friend that produced exactly one dance before we decided it was 
      uneconomical, and a singles magazine that produced just one issue.</p>

    <p>I had met more women than most men meet in a lifetime, leading to one crushing 
      disappointment after another.</p>

    <p>During the most recent 10 years, I had crawled out of my shell as an extreme 
      introvert by becoming a swing dancer, which introduced me to dozens, even hundreds 
      of women. I was good at it too, so for the first time in my life I was popular &ndash; 
      as a dance partner in demand, but that was about it.</p>

    <p>I felt that my biggest hurdle was the fact that I stand 6'8" tall, and the limited 
      feedback I received from women I met for romantic purposes was that I was just too 
      tall. I even joined a club for tall people and was told by one of the members that 
      I was STILL too tall for her!</p>

    <p>With no idea what I should do about that, all I managed to accomplish was to become 
      more depressed.</p>

    <p>So by the Spring of 1998,  after a particularly bad series of dating experiences 
      with a “friend,” I had enough. I threw in the towel. In my gloomy perspective, I 
      tried to come to grips with the fact that I would likely remain an unhappy bachelor 
      the rest of my life.</p>

    <p>I knew nothing about the Law of Attraction at the time. I later realized that my 
      real problem with women was that I had rapidly become more and more negative in my 
      outlook toward women over time, so I expected relationships with them to not work 
      out. And so of course, they didn't. How could they?</p>

    <p>Heck, I practically forgot how to smile, let alone laugh!</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, about six months earlier, my future wife's cat died. She and Shadow had 
      been together for 16 years, and losing him was understandably difficult. But as she 
      emerged from her grief, she made a conscious decision to switch tracks.</p>

    <p>One day a friend asked her if she planned to get another cat.</p>

    <p>"No, I am going to get a husband!" she replied without skipping a beat.</p>

    <p>Her luck with relationships had not been much better than mine. She had one serious 
      relationship that lasted a few years, but in the end it just did not work out. They 
      were not a good match.</p>

    <p>But unlike me, she was determined not to be alone for the rest of her life. So she 
      began a concerted campaign to ask as many people as she could about whether they knew 
      of any emotionally healthy single guys who were available.</p>

    <p>Many years earlier, as a graduate student seeking a degree in Marriage and Family 
      Therapy, she filled out a written "wish list" identifying the characteristics and 
      traits of her ideal mate, an exercise required by one of her professors. Now, after 
      updating it in her mind, she put it out to everyone she knew that she wanted to find 
      that man.</p>

    <p>Not surprisingly, as a professional therapist she had many friends and business 
      associates in the field. Because of what she learned from her own therapy, as well as 
      what she learned through the therapeutic services she supplied to her clients, it had 
      become critically important to her to find someone who was emotionally stable and 
      healthy. That became the basis of the question that she asked everyone with whom she 
      came in contact during her daily life.</p>

    <p>One of the people Louise asked was a fellow therapist whom she did not know really 
      well and perhaps might not have picked as her first choice for making such a request. 
      Dee was a consulting therapist in the family services outfit Louise worked for. She 
      was a little new-agey in her interests, and Louise was not entirely sure that she 
      would know a man that would fit Louise's requirements.</p>

    <p>But she did not let that deter her. She asked anyway. Dee's immediate response was, 
      "Yes, I do know one. Shall I ask him to call you?"</p>

    <p>Just one? Why did Dee think of me when asked for a recommendation for an emotionally 
      stable and healthy male? I have no idea. She knew hundreds of men in the swing dance 
      community, many of whom I would have described as emotionally stable, healthy, and 
      available.</p>

    <p>I later asked her why she thought of me. She just shrugged her shoulders.</p>

    <p>Louise blushed a bit and replied, "Well, maybe you might ask him first whether he 
      might be interested. If he is, give him my phone number. "</p>

    <p>Dee did just that. I had attended some parties and get-togethers she had sponsored, 
      so I wasn’t completely surprised when she called me one Tuesday in early April to 
      explain that she had a coworker who was looking to meet me. Would I be interested?</p>

    <p>Dee's inquiry did catch me off balance, though, as it reopened some old wounds 
      unintentionally. After all, I had just given up on women! We talked for a bit, and 
      I guess I just kinda gave in more than anything else. I certainly was not enthusiastic. 
      Saying yes was more of a default reaction than anything else.</p>

    <p>She gave me Louise's phone number, telling me that the best day to reach her was on 
      Wednesdays. After her call, I left the slip of paper with Louise’s number on the side 
      table in my living room. But the phone number’s existence stuck in my mind, and a day 
      later on April 15, 1998, I decided, <em>Oh what the heck! The worst thing that happens 
      is I get emotionally crushed once again.</em></p>

    <p>I picked up the phone and called her.</p>

    <p>"Hello, my name is Walt Thiessen. A mutual friend, Dee, gave me your phone number. 
      Is this a bad time to call?"</p>

    <p>She replied, "No! Not at all. I was just doing some things around the house. Nothing 
      important."</p>

    <p>I decided before calling that I would talk to her for five or 10 minutes to be polite, 
      probably lose interest, and then hang up. Two hours later, I modified my opinion slightly. 
      Louise had a silly sense of humor that I found refreshing, and unlike so many other 
      women I met, she had not yet given me any signals that she intended to play games with 
      me.</p>

    <p>Of course, it was just one call. I had too much experience with too many women to believe 
      that the final verdict was in.</p>

    <p>We hung up after agreeing to touch base again another time. To be honest, I wasn't so 
      sure I was going to call again, but I did. The next week, again on Wednesday, I phoned 
      her. That conversation also lasted more than two hours. So did the one the following 
      Wednesday.</p>

    <p>After three long phone conversations, I figured it was probably time to try to meet 
      each other. I made it clear during the third conversation how tall I was, without 
      actually specifying the height. I heard the hesitation in her voice, but she said she 
      was 5’6” if she stood up straight.</p>

    <p>I laughed at that, and we agreed to meet the following Saturday at a local restaurant 
      halfway between our respective homes.</p>

    <p>That Saturday, May 2, 1998, we met for lunch at the Maples Restaurant in Middlebury, 
      Connecticut. The food was only so-so, but that was the least of our problems. Louise 
      walked in the door wearing this battered old straw hat that she thought of as quirky, 
      cute, and fun.</p>

    <p>I thought it made her look like a hick.</p>

    <p>To make matters worse, the entire time that we sat to eat and talk together, she refused 
      to look me in the eye. Not once. For whatever reason, we just couldn't make eye contact.</p>

    <p>She also knew exactly how tall I was now!</p>

    <p>We parted company that day with me giving her a tepid promise to call her. She 
      decided on the spot that she would never hear from me again, and if you had pressed 
      me on the point, I probably would've agreed with her assessment.</p>

    <p>Dee had previously scheduled a party for that night that I planned to attend. She, 
      another woman, and myself all shared birthdays that week, so it was a combined birthday 
      party for the three of us. When I showed up at her house, the first question Dee asked 
      me was, "How did the date with Louise go?"</p>

    <p>"Not very well," I replied with a roll of my eyes as I twisted my lips together like 
      I had bitten into something bitter.</p>

    <p>She asked why, and I told her the story. Dee did not blink an eye. She simply asked, 
      "You’re going to follow the three date rule, right?"</p>

    <p>"The what?"</p>

    <p>"The three date rule."</p>

    <p>"Never heard of it."</p>

    <p>"That's where you give it three dates before you make a final decision about whether 
      or not the two of you might be right for each other."</p>

    <p>I had never heard of anything so crazy in my life. We had no chemistry at all. 
      Why would three dates matter?</p>

    <p>I already knew that we had nothing in common. Well, that wasn't quite right. In our 
      phone conversations we actually had quite a bit in common. But in person, we clearly 
      were not getting along in, shall we say, a romantic way.</p>

    <p>After the party as I drove home, I pondered Dee's suggestion. Once again, I kinda 
      shrugged my shoulders and thought, <em>Oh well, what could it hurt? My emotions are 
      so frayed these days that one more disappointment won’t hurt ... much.</em></p>

    <p>For the next date, I invited Louise to go with me to the Norwalk Aquarium. We had a 
      really nice time, and when I took her home, she asked me if I might be interested in 
      rollerblading. It was one of the many subjects we had discussed that day. I told her 
      I wasn't really good at it, but I was willing to give it a shot.</p>

    <p>The rollerblading date went okay too, but when I took her home she "inadvertently" 
      left her sweater in my car. She called me later and asked me if I’d found her sweater. 
      I asked her to hang on and went out to check the car.</p>

    <p>When I came back to confirm that I found it, she asked if I liked strawberry shortcake. 
      I said that I did. She invited me over, and when I got there she introduced me to her 
      new kitten, Eli.</p>

    <p>Being the romantic man that I am, I spent most of the evening playing with the kitten.</p>

    <p>Louise was not impressed, but she was also not deterred.</p>

    <p>I had already told her about my interest in swing dancing. I wanted a partner who 
      knew how to dance. So for the next date, I brought over to her apartment a cassette 
      tape of swing dance music so I could teach her the basic steps.</p>

    <p>To this day, we can't agree who pulled whom in, but that was the night we became 
      a couple.</p>

    <p>I had been in love before, but this was different. It wasn’t that, “Oh god, I 
      desperately need you,” kind of love. This love felt more real, more solid, and 
      surprisingly relaxed. It was the love of a best friend as much as the love of 
      a lover.</p>

    <p>A new feeling began to well up in me, one that I hadn’t experienced in ... well, 
      in a very long time. How long, I couldn’t have said. Perhaps I’d never felt anything 
      like to before. I wasn’t sure, but I also didn’t care one way or the other whether 
      I had.</p>

    <p>In short, I was happy. I mean, I was really happy. I even smiled. A lot. It wasn’t 
      that sexual chemistry kind of happy. It was more like a deep-in-your-being kind of 
      happy, the kind that feels real and permanent.</p>

    <p>Some days later, she pulled out that “wish list” she had written all those years 
      before. To my surprise, I matched every important requirement on her list.</p>

    <p>The height issue didn’t go away without a fight, however. A month after we got 
      together, Louise called me one day to say that she needed a break for a few days 
      because we’d been spending so much time together.</p>

    <p>That nasty little voice in the back of my head piped up.</p>

    <p><em>Here it comes,</em> I thought with a cringe.</p>

    <p>We stayed apart for one night ...</p>

    <p>I thought it was over.</p>

    <p>Little did I know, Louise called her friend Lesley about her situation with me. 
      Lesley asked her what was wrong.</p>

    <p>“He’s just so tall!” Louise said.</p>

    <p>“Okay, what else?” Lesley asked.</p>

    <p>“Well, that’s it. How will we ever fit together?”</p>

    <p>“Louise,” Lesley lectured her, “If that’s the worst 
      thing you can say about him, what are you really afraid of?”</p>

    <p>When she examined her feelings even deeper, Louise realized that she was just 
      so emotionally overwhelmed by being with a guy (me) who was the first guy she 
      had ever met who just loved and accepted her for who she really was.</p>

    <p>She wasn’t used to being treated this way by a lover and a mate, as a woman 
      who deserved to be loved, respected, with emotionally healthy boundaries and 
      being treated as an equal in every way.</p>

    <p>She called me right after that conversation with Lesley to invite me over.</p>

    <p>A little more than a year later, we married.</p>

    <p>For all those years, I felt defeated. Little did I know that all I had to do 
      was give up trying so hard, give up feeling unhappy and depressed about my lack 
      of intimate relationships, and the universe would happily deliver my life mate 
      within a matter of weeks.</p>

    <p>Surprise!</p>

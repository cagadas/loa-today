    <h6 class="h6">by Wendy Dillard</h6>

    <p>After living in many rental properties, I’d had all I could stand of white-colored 
      walls and boring color palettes that rentals provided. So, it wasn’t any surprise to 
      me that I’d been dreaming of my own house where I would have the luxury of painting 
      the walls and decorating it in every conceivable way that my artistic heart desired. 
      Living in a space that reflected my colorful personality felt like the kind of nurturing 
      environment that would nourish my soul.</p>

    <p>When we were financially ready to buy a house, I performed an analysis of home prices 
      around our city and landed on the target area where we could get the most square footage 
      for the lowest price.</p>

    <p>Even though this would be my first house, I didn’t want a typical 3 bedroom / 2 bath 
      starter home because when I want something, I dream BIG! I really wanted 5 bedrooms, 
      but realistically 4 bedrooms was more in line with our budget.</p>

    <p>Since I had been planning for my first house for a long time, I’d developed a pretty 
      long list of criteria, needs and wants. So, here’s an abbreviated list:</p>

    <ul>
      <li class="li">Five bedrooms (which included: a master suite, a guest room, a workroom for me to do 
        my many artistic projects, my office, and a separate office for my husband so we wouldn’t 
        have to share an office anymore. I’m a highly organized neat-freak, and he loves his piles 
        and piles of stuff scattered about everywhere)</li>
      <li class="li">Two to three bathrooms</li>
      <li class="li">An open-concept floor plan</li>
      <li class="li">A nice yard for our dog</li>
      <li class="li">A long and flat driveway that could park a minimum of six cars. (My husband loved to 
        tinker with cars and always had a number of non-running vehicles that he was in the 
        process of restoring. Our current rental house gave birth to this criteria because even 
        though the driveway could hold four cars, the driveway was pitched at a 45 degree angle. 
        It took me forever just to have the courage to drive up or down this steep, monster-like 
        driveway. We ended up replacing the brakes on our cars practically every six months! So, 
        between our personal cars and the ones that my husband was working on, we knew we wanted 
        lots of space to park our cars, and it had to be on a flat surface.)</li>
      <li class="li">We wanted it to be at a price that we could comfortably afford, so we wouldn’t feel
        that every dollar we earned went toward the mortgage.</li>
      <li class="li">And it had to be no-money down!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Needless to say, the list was long. But, my life’s experience had taught me that no dream 
      was too big for God (or the Universe) to deliver.</p>

    <p>As the house-hunting began, we found the four-to-five bedroom houses in our price range 
      were completely unacceptable, which left us feeling melancholy. We thought we might need 
      to compromise or settle for less than what we wanted, causing all the air in our lofty 
      balloon to deflate. My hope of finding my dream home took a huge blow. What do you do 
      when you believe your dream is out there somewhere, but you don’t see any evidence of it?</p>

    <p>A number of months went by. I thought maybe the latest inventory of houses on the market 
      could possibly provide better options. So with renewed energy and vigor, I went back to 
      searching.</p>

    <p>This time we still found a bunch of duds, but the last house on the list showed promise. 
      It was a black-and-white brick, one-story, four bedroom, two bathroom house. The flat 
      driveway wasn’t particularly long, but because of where the house was situated at the end 
      of street, it could work.</p>

    <p>The inside of the house was darling. It checked almost all the boxes on our list. It was 
      in super-duper, wonderful condition. There weren’t any dings or dents in the walls or doors
      (like we saw in the other houses). The back yard was small, but it was beautifully 
      landscaped and definitely appealed to the artist in me.</p>
    
    <p>Overall, the house made my heart smile. Both of us could easily picture ourselves here. 
      While heading home, our excitement was almost uncontainable as we chatted on and on about 
      its attractive curb appeal, charming interior, wonderful floor plan, pristine landscaping, 
      and spacious area for cars.</p>

    <p>We floated on Cloud Nine with smiles fixed indelibly on our faces.</p>

    <p>The only glitch was that we needed $2,000 for a down-payment (which we didn’t have), 
      but we thought for certain that either his parents or mine would happily loan it to us. 
      We knew his parents had the money, so contacting them felt like a formality.</p>

    <p>With a feeling of “this was a done-deal,” my husband called them by phone while I stood 
      close by with great anticipation and a readiness to celebrate. His smile quickly changed 
      to a somber expression. The call was brief. They said “No.” They had a reason as to why 
      the money was not available, but the reason faded as I focused on the shock that they 
      wouldn’t lend us the money for the down-payment.</p>

    <p>We moved on to the backup plan of asking my parents for the money. With the sale of my 
      grandma’s home after she passed on, I knew they had a large amount of cash in the bank. 
      I knew this was a conversation that required me reaching out to my Dad (because he was 
      the decision-maker). He hated talking on the phone, but loved email.</p>

    <p>So, I promptly typed up an email using all the sweetness, charm, and “you love your 
      daughter, don’t you?” wording I could think up. Then we waited ...</p>

    <p>Day One, no response ...</p>

    <p>Day Two, no response ...</p>

    <p>We were practically out of our minds with impatience while waiting for a response from 
      my dad. My thoughts turned to fears as I pictured someone else snatching up the 
      black-and-white brick house. It was not easy to keep calm. I kept reminding myself that 
      IF this was to be our house, that it would be &ndash; and my dad’s delayed response wouldn’t be 
      a problem.</p>

    <p>Finally on Day Three, my inbox held the response from my dad. I’ll never forget his words:</p>
      <blockquote>“After much prayer, your mother and I don’t feel we are to loan you the money. 
        We wish you all the best in finding a new house.”</blockquote>
    
    <p>OMG! This was not at all what we’d expected. Our hearts sank to an all-time low. I re-read 
      his email over and over. I couldn’t believe my dad’s words. But, knowing their religious 
      beliefs, if God had told them “No,” there was no overturning their decision.</p>

    <p>With no other resources available to us, our plans to live in the black-and-white brick 
      house died. We wallowed in anger, sadness, and grief for the next several days as the 
      realization settled in that we’d lost this house.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, after a few days of releasing much pain and sadness, the cheerful, optimistic 
      side of me buoyed back to the surface. I felt an unanticipated surge of knowingness permeate
      my entire being with this inspiring thought: If not this house, then what’s in store for us 
      must be even better!</p>

    <p>With that, I felt jubilantly refreshed as my vision of my dream house was reinvigorated. 
      I knew with every ounce of my being that the house actually awaiting us would be even 
      grander than the black-and-white brick house, because what was yet to show up would truly 
      be The House.</p>

    <p>That thought was so powerful within me, it held me in a sense of hope for an entire year. 
      One day, I felt the nudge to hit the Internet again in search of our house. This time I 
      went into it knowing the exact suburb that would give us the biggest bang for our buck, 
      so that’s where I concentrated my efforts.</p>

    <p>One day, I found a house on April Showers Way that perfectly fit my search criteria. 
      I thought, <em>How cute is that street name?</em></p>

    <p>I could totally live on a street called, “April Showers Way.”  I decided to check it 
      out on my own, so as not to get my husband’s hopes up if it turned out not to be a good 
      option.</p>

    <p>I printed my MapQuest directions, and off I went. When I found the address, I thought 
      to myself: <em>Something about this house doesn’t seem right.</em> The description online 
      was for a two story house, and this was only one story. Feeling misled by whoever wrote 
      up the description, I drove around the neighborhood to see if there would be anything 
      else for sale</p>

    <p>I meandered through the streets of this subdivision where I found a group of six model 
      homes. I went in to check them out. Each one was beautifully staged with furniture, décor, 
      and impeccable landscaping. As I walked through each home, my enthusiasm grew while my 
      artistic-self resonated with the attractive décor. I was in heaven!</p>

    <p>As I opened the front door to this two story, five bedroom house, feelings of fairy 
      tale-like enchantment enveloped me. This enormous house was so big, I actually got lost 
      in it (true story).</p>

    <p>When I walked up the stairs, I couldn’t help but wonder what this house might cost and 
      if it was anywhere within our price range. I strolled from room to room. The master 
      suite’s entrance had two French doors that majestically opened up into the large master 
      bedroom. Even with a king-size bed, there was plenty of space for this room to have a 
      feeling of being absolutely grand.</p>

    <p>Surprisingly, as I walked all the way to the end of the bedroom expecting to find the 
      Bathroom area, I found yet another room that could perhaps be used as a secluded room for 
      reading.</p>

    <p>Tears began to stream down my cheeks as I was filled with an overwhelming flood of joy. 
      This magnificent house was more perfect than I’d ever pictured in all of my imaginations 
      about my dream house. I felt deep within me that I’d come home. There was something about 
      that extra room within the master suite that filled me with feelings of royalty and 
      grandeur like I’d never experienced. It was the icing on the top of my dream-house cake! 
      My tour ended with an enormously sized bathroom, followed by a huge walk-in closet 
      (the size of another bedroom).</p>

    <p>Wiping the tears from my eyes, I pulled out my cell phone to call my husband. He worked 
      nearby, and quitting time was coming soon. I told him I was in the area looking at homes, 
      and asked him to meet me at the model home sales office, because I wanted him to view the 
      model homes. I did my best not to blurt out anything that would broadcast my extreme 
      excitement because I wanted him to have his own experience.</p>

    <p>I walked behind him as he toured the model homes, trying to be as quiet as a mouse so as 
      not to influence him in any way. When he came to the one I’d fallen in love with, he 
      became enthusiastically more vocal about the things he liked. By the time he reached the 
      master suite, he too fell in love with this model as much as I did.</p>

    <p>How’s that for synchronicity and like-mindedness?</p>

    <p>With a particularly large bounce in our steps, we headed off to the sales office. While 
      there, I picked up the sales sheet with the description of the “Chanticlair” Model that 
      we loved. I laughed because it was the exact description of the house on April Showers 
      Way that brought me to this subdivision. I love how guidance doesn’t always come in the 
      package I expect, but the path is always laid out for me.</p>

    <p>The prices were higher than we’d hoped &ndash; big ouch! But, we still talked the salesman’s 
      ear off with our joyful enthusiasm for making a purchase, and we simply acted as though 
      we could afford the model we loved. We left there knowing we’d have to do some creative 
      financing, but we felt “sold” on that model.</p>

    <p>The next weekend was New Year’s Day, and we drove out to the sales office to talk more 
      seriously about locking down one of the pieces of property upon which to build our new 
      home. We thought for sure the sales office would be open to do business, but we were 
      wrong. The office was closed.</p>

    <p>Because we felt such a powerful desire to go there, we thought maybe the purpose of the 
      trip was to drive through the development to select the property we’d build upon. Most of 
      the properties had the driveways either poured or measured-out with stakes. Shockingly, 
      these driveways were tiny &ndash; barely one car length long. The longest was one-and-a-half car 
      lengths long &ndash; definitely not what we were expecting. This meant that none of the available 
      properties would work for us.</p>

    <p>We were back to feeling disappointed and a bit hopeless. This seemed like yet another case 
      of getting our hopes really high, only to have them dashed.</p>

    <p>How was this possible?</p>

    <p>I was once again reminded of the powerful thought: “If not this house, then what’s in store 
      for us must be even better!”</p>

    <p>This encouraged us only slightly.</p>

    <p>While in our saddened state, we drove around the neighborhood next to this new 
      development. I couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw the Chanticlair home in an already 
      developed neighborhood with a "for sale" sign in the front lawn. Could this be real?</p>

    <p>As we looked for a place to park the car, we found yet another Chanticlair home with 
      a "for sale" sign.</p>
    
    <p>Were we in a Twilight Zone episode? It sure felt like it.</p>

    <p>efore we dared to get excited, we drove through the alley where we could see the lengths 
      of the driveways. Astonishingly, the first driveway was about four car lengths long, and 
      the second one was five car lengths long!</p>

    <p>We couldn’t help ourselves. Our hopes sky-rocketed once again. Right before us were two 
      Chanticlairs with long driveways already in existence, and they were for sale.</p>

    <p>We called the listing agents on each of the "for sale" signs. The first house had just 
      sold. The second house was still available, so we scheduled a meeting to see it. When we 
      physically walked into the house, we knew this was truly the one.</p>

    <p>This house was incredibly perfect. It met all the criteria on our list with a few bells 
      and whistles thrown in. The sales price was within our budget, which was lower than the 
      new construction home, and we could buy it with no money down!</p>

    <p>We celebrated by dancing with joy because this house was beyond what we’d ever thought 
      possible. It had our five bedrooms, three bathrooms, and three living rooms. It had an 
      open concept kitchen looking into the living room, and the walls beckoned the brush of 
      my artistic stroke as I envisioned the beautiful colors that would make my heart sing.</p>

    <p>We went home, got all of our ducks in a row financially, and planned to put our offer 
      on the house the next Saturday.</p>

    <p>On Friday before my work day came to an end, I was unexpectedly called into the HR 
      office. Without any warning, I was told that my job had been eliminated. It felt surreal 
      like I was in a movie with a major plot twist. The HR lady continued to speak, but I 
      could barely hear her over the sounds of my own thoughts racing about how this would 
      impact the purchase of our house.</p>

    <p>I didn’t know what to think or what to feel. I felt certain we’d been guided to our 
      house &mdash; and now this?</p>

    <p>When I called my husband from the car to tell him what had just happened, he said 
      with a sad tone of voice, “I guess we won’t be able to buy the house.”</p>

    <p>To which I replied with powerful intensity: “Oh, no &ndash; this is not going to stop us! 
      We found our house, and we’re going to put on offer on it tomorrow as planned.”</p>

    <p>aturday, we met our Realtor and took one more walk through the house drinking in the 
      feeling of being at home. Standing at our soon-to-be kitchen counter, we quickly agreed 
      on the amount we would offer.</p>

    <p>As the Realtor wrapped up the discussion, he asked if we had any questions.</p>

    <p>“Well, there’s one thing. I lost my job yesterday. Will that be a problem?”</p>

    <p>He looked up toward the ceiling and pondered as he composed his answer.</p>

    <p>When he was ready, he looked directly at me and said, “Well, in my 25 years as a 
      Realtor, I’ve dealt with worse circumstances. So your job will be to get a job before 
      the closing.”</p>

    <p>I loved how my job circumstances didn’t derail him, and it definitely gave me the 
      encouragement to go forth and land a new job!</p>

    <p>Our offer was accepted, and we were ecstatic. We’d finally found our dream home. 
      We were relieved that this arduous search had finally come to an end.</p>

    <p>For the next six weeks, I didn’t allow myself to focus on anything except finding 
      a new job. I was in the final round of interviews for a job that would pay about the 
      same salary as my previous job, and it looked good. While driving there, a headhunter 
      from another company called saying that he’d already shared my resume with his client, 
      and they felt I was perfect for the job. I told him that I was really close to securing 
      a job, as I was literally driving to the final interview, but this headhunter was 
      persistent and begged me to call him anyway when I exited the interview.</p>

    <p>When I walked into the final interview at the dairy company, they informed me that the 
      company prioritized hiring from within. They had just learned of an associate desiring 
      to transfer to this office, so they gave her the job.</p>

    <p>As much as I was disappointed, I also felt relieved. Even though I needed a job ASAP, 
      I didn’t really want that one. It didn’t feel challenging enough to hold my interest for 
      long.</p>
    <p>I called the headhunter from the other company. He was right. His client loved me. After 
      one of the easiest interviews I’d ever had, they hired me on the spot. And guess what? 
      The salary was significantly higher than the dairy company. With this salary, we’d have 
      a financial cushion so we wouldn’t just be working to pay the bills, fulfilling another 
      criteria on our list.</p>

    <p>I immediately called our Realtor and told him the good news. He was delighted. I told 
      him that I would start my new job just in time for the paperwork to be drawn up for the 
      closing to happen on time. Closing day went off without a hitch. Whew! We drove around 
      our new city looking for a place for us to have lunch and bask in the joy of 
      home-ownership.</p>

    <p>While directing our movers as they carried our furniture into our new house, I could 
      barely contain my exuberance. This house filled me with such incredible joy. Even after 
      11+ years of living in it, I still get giddy about its perfection.</p>

    <p>We got everything that was important to us about a house. Thank goodness that knowing 
      the ins-and-outs of the Law of Attraction was not necessary for it to show up in our 
      experience, because at the time we didn’t know about Law of Attraction.</p>

    <p>Knowing what I know today, I can see in hindsight how the Law of Attraction coordinated 
      all necessary elements to deliver to us exactly what we desired with a synchronicity I 
      could have never orchestrated. My strong desire and never-give-up attitude played a large 
      role in landing our dream home. And as Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz said, “There’s no 
      place like home.”</p>

    <h6 class="h6">Misti Jackson-Derringer</h6>

    <p>Nearly one year had passed since my mom’s last drink. She seemed okay, 
      having made the transition into living a normal life, but the shadows crept 
      and crawled around, as shadows do. Something big needed to happen. We needed 
      help seeing through these shadows to a better life, a better connection, and 
      certainly a better understanding.</p>

    <p><em>The Shadow Process is a catalyst for our healing as we embrace our darkest 
      side,</em> the pdf read. I checked the dates for the next event: Miami, end of 
      June. My mothers birthday is June 24, Miami is warm, and there's a beach. She 
      loves the beach, as do I.</p>

    <p>I booked the flights and bought the tickets as a birthday present. A vacation 
      in June seemed a perfect way to celebrate her one-year mark of sobriety.</p>

    <p>My childhood was spent in limbo between two parents stuck in their own shadows. 
      I survived the harsh realities of divorce, drug, and alcohol addiction. Years of 
      unworthiness and fear of neglect kept me stuck in a place of complacency. From 
      the exterior I appeared exceptionally grounded, while the inside was a different 
      story.</p>

    <p>We landed in Miami and checked into the hotel, feeling relieved of our daily 
      responsibilities and hopeful to create a newly meaningful relationship between
       mother and daughter. The Shadow event started the next day, so we sat by the 
       pool sipping cool (non-alcoholic) fruity drinks.</p>

    <p>I felt very good about providing my mom this opportunity to get away, to dig 
      deeper.</p>

    <p><em>This will be good for her,</em> I told myself.</p>

    <p>I forgave her long ago. Had to. The grief I felt from mourning my motherless 
      childhood was too much to bear, and forgiveness was freedom from my pain, even 
      when the sadness became a security blanket as I hid behind a confident smile 
      and warm laughter. Her growth would mean my growth. More growth, more forgiveness.</p>

    <p>The next morning, my mother and I showed up excited and ready to take on the 
      program. Armed with our venti lattes and chatting like school girls, we had NO 
      CLUE what we were getting ourselves into.</p>

    <p>Within minutes, the facilitator began giving us her “expectations'” for the next 
      72 hours. She was attractive and well dressed. She knew things, and you could tell. 
      Her story had scars, and she shared them fearlessly.</p>

    <p>She laid out the rules.</p>

    <p>Rule number one: Noble silence except for group exercises.</p>

    <p>She went on: No meat, no sugar, and … <em>no caffeine!</em> She set aside her 
      notes and looked silently at the group. The coaches in the back row sat tall, also 
      knowing something we didn't. Each of them looked like wounded soldiers who hadn't 
      lost the spirit of the fight. From the first moment, I trusted them.</p>

    <p>We each took a long delicious gulp from our over-priced mochas and stared at each 
      other, in shock and awe.</p>

    <p><em>This was not a vacation,</em> we both realized. <em>This was a battlefield, 
      and we had just been informed we would be on the front lines to fight for our healing.</em></p>

    <p>At the first break, forbidden to discuss what had just happened, we tossed out 
      our precious $7 drinks and got some bottled water. The simple fact that we didn't 
      run screaming out of there indicated progress for us.</p>

    <p>In the first session, we listened to story after story of fearlessly facing the 
      shadows from our coaches. I trusted them even more. Stories of loss, pain, grief, 
      and shame poured out from their hearts. We cried, we laughed, but we didn't talk. 
      We listened.</p>

    <p>Over the next three days, we both experienced something deeply profound. We slowly 
      began to understand the nobility piece of the silence. After the first awkward meal 
      with the other noble souls, we started to see the benefits of not blabbing our guts 
      out to everyone and each other.</p>

    <p>We kept our vow for the retreat (minus the initial mouthing and failed attempts to 
      make hand motions to signal what we desperately wanted to say out loud) as we learned 
      then and there that words have power.</p>

    <p>And no words? Even more power internally.</p>

    <p>In my own personal silence, it became a wave of relief not having to explain or 
      excuse myself or listen to others’ explanations or excuses. It was peaceful to not 
      feel the heavy obligation to make meaningless small talk about ignorant things with 
      people we barely knew.</p>

    <p>Most of all, it quickly brought a depth to this experience that nothing else would 
      because when you can't speak, you <em><strong>must listen.</strong></em> You must be 
      open to receive.</p>

    <p>As a southern girl from Tennessee, I had always heard the saying, “The good Lord 
      gave you two ears and one mouth for a reason,” but I just thought that was some 
      redneck saying for “shut the hell up.” And I suppose it was, but not in the way I 
      had once considered.</p>

    <p>Our coaches led us through a shadow-laden process to reveal deeply held judgments 
      and beliefs about ourselves and others. When we weren't listening to our program 
      leaders, we had to listen to our own thoughts. Scary stuff there.</p>

    <p>But without this experience, I would not have the awareness I <em>even had</em> 
      scary thoughts, much less listened to their meaning or intention.</p>

    <p>On the last day of the retreat, we participated in several group exercises in which 
      we journaled things about ourselves we did not want to hear or believe. Some were 
      things we'd tell ourselves and some were things said to us with hurtful intention.</p>

    <p>In short sentences we were expected to speak what we had written, and the group 
      repeated back our words to us. The instructions were simple. Execution was brutal.</p>

    <p>My mom’s list included: "I was a horrible mother."</p>

    <p>She choked out the words over and over. As I wanted to run and silence her, it 
      became clear that I didn't want her to admit this because then it WAS true. With 
      each time she repeated it, I was reminded how terrible it had been and how deeply 
      wounded I was.</p>

    <p>Our group drove in the knives as we repeated, "You were a horrible mother." The 
      knife of her words hit me over and over. Repeating the words in confirmation of 
      this fact stung like a thousand needles.</p>

    <p>Then in an instant, I realized – where I felt a knife, she felt a sword. Where 
      I felt needles, she felt razors. My compassion arose as hot tears fell down both 
      our faces.</p>

    <p>Working our way through our breakout tribe of shadow warriors, we continued. When 
      my turn came, tears began to flow. Where to begin? Which shadow that had been hidden 
      in my wounds could I choose.</p>

    <p>I took a long breath and tried to gather myself. My mother's eyes welled as her 
      own shadow wounds lay open, bleeding for all to see, and she knew the pain I felt 
      in my heart. Yet she looked at me with a fierce love that gave me the courage to 
      speak. I had her support, and in that moment I had never needed it more.</p>

    <p>"I am unlovable," I whispered, voice shaking.</p>

    <p>My group spoke it back to me, and their words pierced my soul. I continued saying 
      it over and over until something loosened inside. I wept as I looked at my mother 
      and said what I had always felt. We connected and again her fierce look of love 
      gave me the push to go on until I heard these words as only sounds.</p>

    <p>The power of my words had not been in the sounds but in the meaning and truth I 
      granted them.</p>

    <p>We were strictly limited to the script we had written, and no one got out of the 
      hot seat until they were crying their damn eyes out and shaking all over.</p>

    <p>Believe me, noble silence came easily that day as no one wanted to say a word 
      during the break. We were all so shaken up, it was as though there had been some 
      sort of mass spoken exorcism of words.</p>

    <p>The final program exercise was to set up in the same groups. This time, we had 
      the chance to say what we wanted to say. What we really needed to say to ourselves, 
      out loud, to set a new intention for our lives where the raw hole had been hallowed 
      out before.</p>

    <p>After a weekend of cultivation and awareness of words (or lack there of) we were 
      more than ready to express our truest selves aloud. Statements filled with love 
      and compassion. Words of hope and intention.</p>

    <p>Again my brave mother took her seat opposite us. She took a breath and stated 
      timidly, "I am a wonderful grandmother."</p>

    <p>We confirmed her words with ours, "You ARE a wonderful grandmother." Loudly 
      enunciating each word for her as we were given the chance to repeat her bold 
      statement. "YOU are a wonderful grandmother." Again, "You are a wonderful 
      GRANDMOTHER."</p>

    <p>She began to smile as we saw a visceral acceptance of pride grow in her eyes, 
      melting my heart with her truth. She is a wonderful grandmother. My children have 
      had the very best of her, which meant I had also received that precious gift.</p>

    <p>She went on to admit another truth. "I am safe," she proclaimed. I realized I 
      had never considered my mother to be fearful of ANYTHING. Yet here she was telling 
      us she desperately wanted to feel safe.</p>

    <p>We confirmed her statement. "You ARE safe." Our embrace when she completed her 
      turn was all we had both wanted and needed.</p>

    <p>Once again, it was my turn to speak truth. I sat with an excitement for the 
      next words I would speak.</p>

    <p>"I am a good mother." I said firmly. I locked eyes with her first as she repeated 
      the fact back to me the way only a mother can do.</p>

    <p>Each time I said it, her heart healed more and mine leaped for joy. Our eyes 
      locked deeper and we both knew in that moment the reason we had come here.</p>

    <p>The healing that took place in these brutal and honest statements sealed off 
      the wounds we had carried for one another.</p>

    <p>I looked down at my next statement, but as I opened my mouth those words didn't 
      come out. Instead, as though a voice from my soul spoke into my heart I blurted 
      out instead, "I am a spiritual guide."</p>

    <p>Electricity shot through every cell in my body, as I looked shocked at my mother 
      who leaned forward and confirmed it loudly with her fellow team of repeaters, "YOU 
      ARE A SPIRITUAL GUIDE." I said it again and again until the words were very much 
      my own: "I am a spiritual guide."</p>

    <p>I had found purpose for the pain that feeling unlovable for so long had gifted me.</p>

    <p>After the program ended, my mom and I went for another venti coffee and then for 
      a huge steak dinner that night. We spent the entire evening recapping the incredible 
      gift we had received, a powerful tool that separated fact from fiction in our 
      awareness. We now understood the power of our words, spoken or not, and how they 
      created the life we called our own.</p>

    <p>Our words attract our outcomes, and we were both amazed at how something as simple 
      as “noble silence” could be the catalyst to speaking with intention.</p>

    <p>My words, "I am a spiritual guide," connected me to the universal power of attraction. 
      Today, I am a spiritual guide, a certified yoga instructor, and a certified holistic 
      leadership coach. I now do the work to guide others spiritually back to their own 
      truth. I travel, speak, and train others to be guides.</p>

    <p>Almost five years later, my mom continues to feel safe in her sobriety, and she 
      supports my family by being a WONDERFUL grandmother.</p>

    <p>Quite literally, our life is the words we speak both inside our head and out to 
      the rest of the world.  We are living proof that your words most definitely have 
      the power to create your reality and to redeem your past.</p>

    <p>“Can you share your Law of Attraction manifestation story?”</p>

    <p>That’s a question most students of LOA like to get answered whenever possible.</p>

    <p>The basic concept of LOA is simple. As Abraham-Hicks puts it, “That which is like 
      unto itself is drawn.”</p>

    <p>But what about applying LOA in their “real world” lives? That’s where students of 
      LOA often trip up. So hearing the successful manifestation stories of others often 
      help us all to believe, despite what “reality” insists on telling us.</p>

    <p>I put that word “reality” into quotation marks to remind us that reality is what 
      we make of it and that even scientists have trouble making sense out of it.</p>

    <p>Once Albert Einstein ripped open Pandora’s Box with his General and Special Theories 
      of Relativity in the early twentieth century, human scientists stopped thinking of 
      reality as being fixed and immutable. Now there’s quantum physics, dark energy, the 
      observer effect, and a host of other relatively new scientific terms invented to make 
      sense out of what Einstein uncovered, stuff which often seems almost insensible.</p>

    <p>The New Thought movement of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the 
      precursor of modern day LOA thought, latched onto Einstein quickly, but the scientific 
      community didn’t accept New Thought explanations as anything but “nonsense” or “wishful 
      thinking”. To this day, the Law of Attraction and its other related concepts are largely 
      ridiculed and rejected by mainstream science.</p>

    <p>That “reality” does not stop the rest of us from exploring and embracing the Law of 
      Attraction. To the contrary, so many people have taken an interest in LOA that it has 
      become a worldwide phenomenon.  Rhonda Byrne’s movie, The Secret, helped LOA reach many 
      millions of people who had not previously heard of it, and it has gained significant 
      recognition among the population.</p>

    <p>I discovered LOA by watching The Secret for the first time in November 2008. My first 
      reaction was skepticism, but I was also in such a bad place in my own life that I was 
      willing to consider almost anything. And so I did. I launched into a personal study of 
      this LOA thing, determined to either harness it for myself or to prove it to be a bunch 
      of rot.</p>

    <p>In September 2012, with the help of my wife, Louise, I decided to start a podcast on 
      the subject. I called it LOA Today, and it became my personal way to explore LOA concepts 
      by interviewing other people who knew more about it than I did.</p>

    <p>To my surprise and pleasure, I found that the podcast became one of my favorite things 
      to do, even though I had no listeners at all at first and only an occasional listener 
      dropping in throughout most of the first year.</p>
    
    <p>In the second year after a brief sabbatical, my brother, Mark and his then-girlfriend 
      (now wife), Uohna became my co-hosts.</p>

    <p>By the third year, Mark and Uohna had given way to Joel Elston, one of my first 
      interviewees in Episode 12. Joel stayed with me until April 2017, at which point he had 
      to leave the show to attend to other things in his life.</p>

    <p>David Scott Bartky took Joel’s place, and during that summer something remarkable began 
      to happen. Our listenership started to increase at a rapid rate. By November 2017, we had 
      as many episodes played in a month as had been played in all the previous five years 
      combined.</p>

    <p>That led to me expanding the podcast to a twice daily broadcast, and I brought on board 
      Wendy Dillard, Cindie Chavez, and Tom Wells to co-host the shows with me, with Joel Elston 
      returning to the show as well (to my delight).</p>

    <p>The one characteristic all of my co-hosts shared in common is that they are professional 
      life coaches or therapists. I figured that if I was going to do a podcast, I wanted expert 
      commentary.</p>

    <p>In a matter of weeks, both Wendy and Cindie told me about book projects they’d been 
      involved with. Apparently, both had contributed to multi-author anthologies where all of 
      the authors contributed not only to the book but also to promoting the marketing of the 
      book through their social connections online.</p>

    <p>As soon as I heard about these projects, I wondered, <em>Would it be possible to use the 
      same technique to promote our LOA Today podcast?</em></p>

    <p>Within a couple more weeks, I became obsessed with the idea of doing an anthology style 
      book sharing personal manifestation stories with as many students of the Law of Attraction 
      as we can find. These would be real stories told by real-life people in the LOA field from 
      their own life experiences.</p>

    <p>I imagined it to be an LOA version of Jack Canfield’s world-famous <em>Chicken Soup For 
      The Soul</em> series of books. No one needs positive reinforcement and confidence building 
      more than “deliberate creators” attempting to leverage the Law of Attraction in their daily 
      lives. What better way to get such leverage than from the real-life experiences of others 
      who are equally devoted to studying and applying this marvelous universal law?</p>

    <p>You hold the result in your hands.</p>

    <p>I’ve organized the book into sections, to make it easy for readers to find particular 
      kinds of stories. You can find stories about manifesting new homes and offices, 
      relationship, careers, improved health, new cars, and even the weather.</p>

    <p>You will find a wide range of perspectives in the enclosed stories. Perspective is a 
      key concept in LOA, and it plays no less of an important role here. So many perspectives, 
      39 in all, came together to create such a great book.</p>

    <p>So you’ll find stories that range from really happy, light-hearted pieces such as Keisha
      Clark’s “My Birthday Bath”, to the dark, blunt, and even brutal experiences detailed by
      Misti Jackson-Derringer in her story, “Boot Camp”.</p>

    <p>You’ll find stories where the main players didn’t even know how LOA worked, side-by-side 
      with stories from experienced practitioners who knew exactly what they wanted to attract 
      and how to do it deliberately.</p>

    <p>The stories range from being locked in a garage and using our inner voice to get out, 
      to following one’s nose all the way out to an oceanic adventure.</p>

    <p>The emphasis on what’s important varies considerably from story to story, just as the 
      voices of the different authors also vary.</p>

    <p>Some stories emphasize the internal self-talk and self-listening. Others emphasize 
      physical talk and actions. Some emphasize theory, while others emphasize feeling your way.</p>

    <p>But they all have one thing in common. They are all stories of things, experiences, and 
      events that occurred by thinking and feeling about them <strong>first</strong>.</p>

    <p>The Law of Attraction always operates in everything that comes into our lives. This book 
      not only recognizes that fact but also plays up stories where LOA’s role is clear.</p>

    <p>The main criteria that your editor used when putting the book together was to make the 
      book a collection of stories. Our purpose here is to entertain and inspire rather than to 
      teach. We hope you agree that this is really the best way to hear other peoples’ stories.</p>

    <p>On behalf of all the authors of this book, I hope you’ll find this book is a bright light 
      in your daily life. Perhaps it will take a place on your coffee table for you to read for 
      a bit whenever you need a pick-me-up. Or perhaps it will adorn your bedside table, giving 
      you some happy thoughts before you go to sleep at night.</p>

    <p>Just like what we say about the LOA Today podcasts, we hope that his book becomes Your 
      Daily Dose of Happy, one that not only provides you with inspiration and reinforces your 
      belief in yourself and in what you want most to manifest into your life, but also gives 
      you something you are eager to share with friends and families.</p>

    <p>I want to thank all of the people who have played roles both in the creation of this 
      book and in helping me to develop the LOA Today podcast over the years. Hopefully, I 
      don’t leave anyone out. If I do, please accept my apologies.</p>

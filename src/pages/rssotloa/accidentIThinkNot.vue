    <h5 class="h5 bottom0">Accident, I think not!</h5>
    <h6 class="h6">By Wendy Dillard</h6>

    <p>We were driving home while engaged in casual conversation when all of a sudden ... 
      Bang &ndash; Boom &ndash; Crunch! Our lovely morning drive came to an abrupt end 
      as we’d just been rear-ended. I hit my head on the side of the car really hard, 
      causing me to go into a state of shock. What happened next was pretty fuzzy in 
      my memory, but I do recall there was an ambulance and several squad cars at the 
      scene of the accident within no time at all.</p>

    <p>I only got a glimpse of the young guy that hit us. Based on the skid marks on 
      the pavement, our best guess was that he was texting while driving and didn’t notice 
      when we came to a stop while waiting to make a left turn on a narrow two-lane road.</p>

    <p>I didn’t know about the Law of Attraction at that time, but I had a strong belief 
      that we contribute to what shows up in our life. At the time, we couldn’t think of 
      anything that we’d been thinking that might have led to this car accident. But we 
      recognized that we might receive greater understanding down the road, and we felt 
      quite fortunate that our injuries were minor and that we had insurance to cover our 
      many trips to the chiropractor.</p>

    <p>Our insurance company considered our car <em>totaled,</em> which was a huge bummer 
      because I’d just received this car as a gift from my mother-in-law about six months 
      before.</p>

    <p>We’d been through quite a fascinating history where cars were concerned. Less 
      than two years before, I drove my limping Ford Taurus to the dealership (after 
      hours) where I parked it, assuming it’s condition was well beyond our financial 
      ability to repair it. I left the key with a note explaining its troubles while 
      sobbing as I mourned the loss of my much-loved car.</p>

    <p>The next morning, the mechanic confirmed our suspicions … the engine was a goner, 
      and the repair would cost about $6,000. We’d have to walk away from my Taurus.</p>

    <p>For a while we shared his car, but that was not a long-term solution.</p>

    <p>We decided to ask my husband’s parents if we could borrow one of their cars for 
      a short time. They had two cars, but my father-in-law rarely drove anymore in favor 
      of my mother-in-law chauffeuring him around. They said “yes,” and I temporarily had 
      wheels again.</p>

    <p>A short time later, they decided to “gift” the car to us. We were both overwhelmingly 
      grateful and relieved, because we still didn’t have the financial means to replace my 
      car.</p>

    <p>For the first time I got a taste of not having car payments, as both the car given 
      to us and my husband’s car were paid off. I felt this wonderful sensation fill me with 
      a knowingness I was tracking toward the financial freedom I desired.</p>

    <p>Sometime later, my mother-in-law had her eye on another new car for herself, which 
      we thought was crazy because she’d purchased a brand new Taurus (off the showroom 
      floor) just a short time before. So, we assumed she’d pass her Taurus to her husband. 
      Then, in a shocking conversation with her, she announced that they didn’t see the 
      need for two cars anymore. And what she wanted to propose was for her to “gift” her 
      Taurus to us, and in return we’d “gift” the car I’d been driving to her brother. </p>

    <p><em>Hello!!!</em> Of course we accepted the deal, who wouldn’t? </p>

    <p>Within the next couple of days, cars were exchanged, and I was driving her gorgeous 
      Taurus!</p>

    <p>What no one knew was that the day she showed us her new Taurus two years before, 
      I claimed that car for myself by silently saying in my mind, “That’s my car!” I 
      didn’t tell anyone about this, not even my husband. </p>

    <p>You see, I loved Tauruses. I’d already had three Tauruses, each of which I 
      thoroughly enjoyed, but there was something special about the one that she had. 
      It had lots of extras that my Tauruses didn’t. </p>

    <p>And the thing that really got my motor running was the sleek tail fin on the trunk 
      which I thought looked really classy. Her Taurus gave me a feeling of extravagance 
      that excited me. </p>

    <p>So, when I say I wanted her car, <em>I really did.</em> But, I never thought it 
      would happen. And yet, here I was in her Ford Taurus where my heart leaped for joy 
      as I was completely blown away at this magical moment. </p>

    <p>I love free stuff, don’t you? </p>

    <p>Now, with my fourth Taurus rear-ended and declared totaled, we received a check 
      from the insurance company for $5,600. This was much less than we’d expected 
      considering the car wasn’t that old. </p>

    <p>In the spirit of moving forward, my husband asked, 
      “What kind of car do you want now?” </p>

    <p>I gave it a moment as I pondered the answer. </p>

    <p>“A Jaguar,” I said. </p>

    <p>My husband replied, “Really, you want a Jaguar? I’ve never heard you <em>ever</em> 
      talk about Jaguars. Where did that idea come from?” </p>

    <p>“I don’t know,” I said, “but that’s what I want, a Jaguar.” </p>

    <p>He said, “You know you’re not going to find a Jaguar for $5,600.” </p>

    <p>I blurted out, “Watch me!” </p>

    <p>I’d never looked for a Jaguar before, so I had no idea what they cost. I had
      no idea what they even looked like. Even I was shocked to hear myself say I 
      wanted one, but I knew I did. It just felt right to me.</p>

    <p>So, I began searching for Jaguars. </p>

    <p>I got quite the education. Jaguars really are expensive. Even pre-owned ones 
      are expensive … definitely more than $5,600.</p>

    <p>I wasn’t willing to settle for anything less than a car that made me smile 
      every time I drove it. Also, I became aware of the growing importance that I 
      desired to buy this car with ALL cash, because I never wanted car payments ever 
      again ... and I meant it!</p>

    <p>After finding some possibilities online, we headed out to see them. While on 
      the car lots, we also looked at other cars just in case I might find myself 
      interested in something other than a Jaguar. My husband and I walked in different 
      directions to cover more territory, then called to each other when we found 
      something good. We looked at a lot of cars over the course of one weekend, but 
      nothing really hit the spot for me. </p>

    <p>While heading back home, I recall my husband telling me that every time he 
      called me over to look at a Lexus, BMW or Mercedes, he noticed that my attention 
      was fixated on a Jaguar, and he had a hard time pulling me away to look at the 
      cars he’d found. This interested me because I was unaware of this and wondered 
      what it was about Jaguars that captured my attention so fully. Honestly, I didn’t 
      even know what any luxury car looked like by body style. I was generally drawn to 
      a car for its color or shape. </p>

    <p>The car lot experiences helped me to understand that <em>what I really wanted 
      in my next car was the feeling of luxury.</em> Jaguars represented a huge step up 
      from the previous cars I’d had because I thought of Jaguars as wonderfully exotic. </p>

    <p>In the past, I’d had what I’d perceived as <em>average cars,</em> and I had a 
      powerful readiness to drive something that gave me a feeling of <em>first-class 
      lifestyle and wealth.</em> This wasn’t because I wanted to impress anyone; it 
      was completely for my own personal satisfaction. I wanted to experience feelings 
      that “wealthy people” experienced ... and I thought that having a luxury car would 
      do that for me.</p>

    <p>My husband recognized that I was doggedly determined to get a Jaguar and to pay 
      for it with ALL cash, but he didn’t see how it would be possible to find one for 
      only $5,600 as the prices of the Jaguars we saw were significantly higher than the 
      money we had. </p>

    <p>Again and again, I said to him, “Just watch me!”</p>

    <p>I knew where I was willing to be flexible and where I wasn’t. And I really didn’t 
      want to budge on the idea of having a car payment. I knew <em>something</em> must 
      be was out there that I could buy with <em>ALL cash.</em> I imagined a story that 
      there would be a beautifully kept Jaguar that had been owned by an older couple who 
      barely drove it. They kept it in a garage and traded it in when it was just out of 
      warranty so it still had low mileage. The more I told myself this story, the more 
      I believed a car like this existed, and it was just waiting for me to find it.</p>

    <p>While searching online, I found a Jaguar with only 63,000 miles. It was six years 
      old and cost $9,950. I wondered if the list price was accurate because it was so 
      much lower than others I’d seen for this model year. The color was called <em>quartz</em> 
      (which was a beautiful shade of gray). I thought being called <em>quartz</em> sounded 
      snazzy! I know the price was higher than the insurance money I had, but I was drawn to 
      this car. </p>

    <p>So, we went to see it. It was more beautiful than I’d ever imaged. There wasn’t one 
      blemish on it. It looked brand-new (just like I’d been imaging in my mind). It drove 
      like a dream and had awesome power under the hood. Test driving this Jaguar stirred 
      up a delightful feeling of wealth within me, and I loved it.</p>

    <p>I’d fallen in love with this Jaguar and wanted it really bad, but what about the 
      price? </p>

    <p>We sat in the lobby trying to figure out where the rest of the money might come 
      from. My back was to the door while other customers walked in, when abruptly my 
      husband said, “That man is asking about YOUR car, so if you want it, you’d better 
      tell them now.” </p>

    <p>So, with barely a hesitation, I jumped up and headed over to the salesman behind 
      the counter. I told him I definitely wanted to buy that quartz-colored Jaguar, but 
      that I didn’t have all the money right now. He said they could hold it for me for 
      10 days with a $2,000 non-refundable deposit. I said I could give him the $2,000 
      now, but I needed 14 days to get the rest. He said they could only hold it for 10 
      days. I asked again with a pleading tone of voice, but he didn’t budge.</p>

    <p>I asked if I could talk to his manager, and he kindly directed me to the manager’s 
      office. I told the manager how much I wanted that Jaguar, but I needed 14 days 
      before I had the full amount. He repeated the same story about the 10-day holding 
      limit. Then with a determination that filled my whole being (as well as the tone 
      in my voice), I explained how I only had $5,600 from the insurance company. And in 
      order to gather the rest of the money, I would use all the money in my saving 
      account plus I’d use next my paycheck, which wouldn’t come for 14 days. </p>

    <p>I went on to say that by giving him a check for $2,000, I was guaranteeing him 
      that I would return in exactly 14 days with the balance. After all, I couldn’t 
      afford to lose that $2,000 in my financial state. Thus, a $2000 deposit was my 
      way of saying <em>this deal was as good as done!</em></p>

    <p>My impassioned plea did the trick as I watched his expression soften toward me. 
      He extended the holding period to 14 days! </p>

    <p>I was ecstatic.</p>

    <p>I did have to do some creative juggling with the bills that I had intended 
      to pay with my next paycheck, but it was worth it to buy my Jaguar with <em>ALL 
      cash</em> so I could keep with my plan to not have car payments.</p>

    <p>Two weeks later, I returned with the rest of the money to pick up <em>my</em> 
      Jaguar. It was an electrifying moment! Not only was I going to own and drive a 
      Jaguar, but I also got to experience paying for a car with <em>ALL cash</em> … 
      something I presumed only wealthy people did!</p>

    <p>Each day, I’d look out of my second story window admiring my Jaguar as it was 
      majestically parked on my driveway. Neighbors walked over to chat with me about 
      my new car. It was their unanimous opinion that I’d benefited from a big 
      promotion allowing me to buy it. They thought it was brand new and had no idea 
      it was six years old. </p>

    <p>Each neighbor spoke with a tone of voice filled with awe, but also slightly 
      sarcastic … as if to say they were jealous of me. This was evidence to me that 
      my Jaguar had a perceived value that was far beyond the dollars I actually paid. </p>

    <p>As a matter of fact, the neighbor who seemed the most jealous had just spent 
      $65,000 on his new SUV that had all the bells and whistles. I chose not to tell 
      him how much I actually paid for my sophisticated-looking Jaguar, letting him 
      believe whatever he wanted.</p>

    <p>Recognizing the power of perceived value, I decided to increase the fun by 
      getting personalized plates. My license plate is IAMHPY. While fueling up my 
      Jaguar, strangers often get my attention by giving me two thumbs up while wearing 
      big smiles as they point toward my license plate. I love it … not only does my Jag 
      give me incredible pleasure, but it does it for others too!</p>

    <p>Here’s a fun addendum to my story... I had been encouraging my husband for the 
      past couple of years to buy a new car, but he didn’t feel we should spend the money 
      while his car still ran. Then one very cold, wintry day, my husband got in his car 
      to leave for work at 4:30 AM. His car didn’t have a working blower, so that meant 
      there was nothing to de-fog his very frosted windows, let alone provide heat to him. 
      He headed off to work by sticking his head out the window to see where he was going. </p>

    <p>Thank goodness he only worked three miles from the house, and at that hour no one 
      else was on the road. However, this situation was a huge turning point for him.</p>

    <p>When he arrived home from work, he told me about the conditions he endured that 
      morning. He told me that while letting his car engine warm up, he looked over at 
      my Jaguar knowing it had a working heater, a working de-fogger, as well as seat 
      warmers. And there he was in his pitifully falling apart car. </p>

    <p>That was the very moment that caused him to realize that if his wife could have 
      a Jaguar, then he deserved to have a wonderful car too. I was thrilled my Jag 
      provided the inspiration to up-level his thinking.</p>

    <p>Around this time, the medical portion of our insurance claim was settled, and 
      we received a check for $10,000. With that, we were ready to shop for my husband’s 
      next car. I did for him what I did for myself. He wanted a Jaguar too, but he 
      wanted the sporty version, whereas I had the sedan. He told me the exact model 
      he wanted and said it had to be the British Green one. And once again, he didn’t 
      believe it would be possible to find this specific Jaguar with only $10,000. To 
      which I said once again, “Watch me!” </p>

    <p>The same story unfolded … I found the exact model he wanted in British Green. 
      The cost was $12,500 for which we managed to find the extra cash needed within 
      our personal resources. Once again, no car payments!!</p>

    <p>Can you image the shock on our neighbors’ faces when they saw a second Jaguar 
      on our driveway? Yes, we now had His & Hers Jaguars. We became the talk of the 
      town, and no one was the wiser that between our two Jags, we paid less than you 
      would have paid for <em>one average car!</em></p>

    <p>Owning and driving my Jaguar did exactly what I hoped it would do. Every time 
      I sit in my car or even look at it parked on the driveway, I swell with 
      <em>feelings of wealth and abundance.</em> Owning this Jaguar has propelled 
      my abundance quotient in a big way. Now I live in the <em>knowing</em> that I 
      can truly have anything my heart desires.</p>

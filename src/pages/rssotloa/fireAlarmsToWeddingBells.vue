    <h6 class="h6">By Anik Clemens</h6>

    <p>The paper I held in my hand started to crumble in one corner as the flame 
      took hold. I blew out the match and tossed it in the kitchen sink. As the 
      flame grew larger, the words began to disappear from the page, slowly at first 
      and then more quickly. The written attributes of my ideal mate were turning to 
      ash and floating up toward the ceiling. One day, at the right time and place, 
      my ideal partner would arrive, and we would be a family.</p>

    <p>That was my wish, anyway. To release this three page document I had written 
      of all of the characteristics of my ideal partner into the atmosphere, so that 
      the Universe would conspire to one day bring me the man of my dreams.</p>

    <p>But then….</p>

    <p>Eeeeernt! Eeeeeernt! Eeeeernt!</p>

    <p>An alarm … a fire alarm!</p>

    <p>I was pulled out of my reverie and into reality.</p>

    <p>Perfect. Just perfect. I had set off the fire alarm.</p>

    <p>My daughter … she will surely wake up.</p>

    <p>I ran into my daughter’s room, and there was my 
      one-and-a-half-year-old wide awake and sitting up in bed.</p>

    <p>“Mommy!” she started to cry.</p>

    <p>“Don’t worry sweetie. Mommy set off the fire alarm by accident. 
      It’s not a real fire. Come with me.”</p>

    <p>I swung her out of her crib and onto my hip, and we walked out 
      of the apartment and into the hallway to see if the fire alarm 
      was in the whole building.</p>

    <p>Luckily it was just in our apartment. Phew.  I was sure I had 
      woken up a number of neighbors. My brilliant idea to burn my list 
      came at 11 PM when everyone was already sleeping.</p>

    <p>I was a single mother of one daughter, and we lived in an apartment 
      while I looked to purchase a townhouse. We had just moved out of our 
      single-family ranch house where we had lived with her father, my then 
      fiancé, which had not been a good situation. We were just so wrong 
      for each other.</p>

    <p>I was sick and tired of being with the wrong guy, and now I had a 
      daughter to take care of and wanted only the best for us. I knew I 
      deserved the man of my dreams. But how could I meet him?</p>

    <p>I had heard about writing a wish list of attributes that you want 
      in your ideal partner. Now looking back on this fire alarm incident, 
      I have to laugh! It must have been the Universe telling me that my 
      list was all wrong!</p>

    <p>The men that came into my life after writing this first list were 
      not my ideal partner. They had some of the attributes on the list but 
      not all of them. And there were some things that were clearly wrong. 
      One had opposite political views.  One was sweet but not very attractive.
       One was chauvinistic. I dated all kinds of men, but none of them were 
       the right one for me.</p>

    <p>Two years later I wrote another list. This time I narrowed down the 
      attributes to one page. I included only those attributes that I wanted 
      in a partner. I skipped the things I didn’t want</p>

    <p>The next person that came into my life romantically was an old friend 
      who had had a crush on me for the past 10 years.</p>

    <p>A salty seaman he was, with dark wispy hair, sun-kissed skin, strong 
      legs, and a musical talent that sent me to tears. He could play any 
      instrument including the guitar, banjo, ukulele, didgeridoo, bongos, 
      fiddle and flute. He’d woo me with beautiful melodies and put my 
      daughter to sleep at night with lullabies. After six months of Facetime 
      flirting, he decided to come for a visit.</p>

    <p>He bought an old pickup truck, packed up all of his belongings, and 
      drove from Arizona to Florida. Two weeks later, he unloaded all of his 
      things into my garage and moved in. The three of us cooked together, 
      went to the beach, played at the park, paddled out into the ocean, 
      laughed, took long walks, and sang songs. It was a beautiful time 
      together.</p>

    <p>But something was missing.  We had the here and the now, but there was 
      no future.  We didn’t have the same goals or the same aspirations. It 
      was time to say goodbye. And just as quickly as he came, he was gone.</p>

    <p>Why was I not attracting the right person into my life?</p>

    <p>What was I doing wrong?</p>

    <p>Two years later I wrote my third list. And this time I simplified it 
      down to four things. This is how I wanted to FEEL in a partnership. 
      These were not attributes I wanted in my mate, but how I wanted to 
      feel when I was with my mate. I wanted these feelings to last a 
      lifetime.  So, I wrote them down.  I said them out loud. I embodied 
      them.</p>

    <p class="signature">I am LOVED.<br />
    I am SUPPORTED.<br />
    I am CHERISHED.<br />
    I am ADORED.</p>

    <p>That’s it. It was super simple. It became my mantra. I would say it 
      over and over every day. Day and night, I said my mantra, I felt my 
      mantra, I embodied my mantra. Soon enough I was living and breathing
       my mantra.</p>

    <p>I changed the way I treated myself. I supported, loved, cherished and 
      adored myself. And this is how I wanted my ideal partner to treat me.</p>

    <p>I met my perfect match, the man of my dreams, my partner and my best 
      friend after six months of repeating my mantra out loud over and over 
      again every day.</p>

    <p>At this time, my daughter was five years old. One of the things we 
      loved to do together was to go stand-up paddle boarding. It’s something 
      we could do together, while being in nature, getting some sun, exercising, 
      and seeing all the amazing creatures that live in and near the water.</p>

    <p>Also at this time, I was looking for a new business partner with whom to 
      lead retreats. Being a life coach, one of the things I find very rewarding 
      for people is getting back to nature and having a reset time where they can 
      connect more with themselves in a peaceful location. I started leading 
      outdoor retreats in 2014. In 2016, I was looking for a new partner. A mutual 
      friend introduced me to a lovely yoga teacher named Heather.</p>

    <p>“Of course, I’d love to partner with you. I have a whole fleet of paddle 
      boards, and I know just the location we could hold our retreat … Rainbow River. 
      It’s a beautiful spring fed river in northern Florida. It will be perfect 
      for an outdoor adventure. And my twin brother helps out with all the paddle 
      board stuff. We’ll make a great team.”</p>

    <p>I had no idea what to expect when I met her twin, but if he was anything like 
      his sister, I was sure going to like him.</p>

    <p>The first time I met him was at a unique paddle board spot on the Gulf of 
      Mexico called the Stilt Houses. It’s where nine stilt houses were built a 
      mile offshore in the early 1900s as a fishing village. We took a group of 
      paddlers to check them out and explore the island nearby.</p>

    <p>He and I were the first to arrive.</p>

    <p>When I saw him walk towards me, I knew it was “him”.</p>

    <p>The first thing I noticed about him was how tan he was. Glistening from 
      his suntan oil and the sun hitting his chest, he looked very Italian! He 
      wore a gold chain with a crucifix pendant around his neck. He smiled and 
      his crooked tooth in the front stood out to me. He was absolutely gorgeous.</p>

    <p>“Hey there. You must be Heather’s brother,” I said nervously as we 
      approached each other.</p>

    <p>“Yes. I’m Fred.”</p>

    <p>Fred. I would have never guessed his name would be Fred. He didn’t look 
      like a Fred. It didn’t seem to match his looks or personality … an Ian maybe, 
      or an Eric, but not a Fred.</p>

    <p>“Well then, Fred, it’s nice to meet you. I’m Anik. I’m partnering with you 
      and Heather. Shall we go check out a good launch site?”</p>

    <p>“Yes we shall.”</p>

    <p>The rest of the day we were glued to each other. It was like we were on a 
      date but with six other people there.</p>

    <p>We chatted about our lives and got to know each other as we paddled out into 
      the Gulf of Mexico. So many of our interests lined up. Both of our families 
      were tight knit.  We came to find out we had similar values. We both have 
      kids and neither of us wanted any more children. We seemed to want the same 
      things in life.</p>

    <p>Conversation flowed easily. We managed to keep an eye on the other paddlers 
      and help them out when needed, but then we would find each other again and 
      continue the conversation.  We were enraptured.</p>

    <p>The first time he met my daughter was on another paddle. This time we paddled 
      Weeki Wachee Springs, a six-mile river that is home to many manatees in the winter. 
      My daughter absolutely loves this paddle. She sits on my paddle board right in 
      front of me and points out the wildlife.</p>

    <p>“Mommy! Look over there. It’s a manatee!!”</p>

    <p>“Mom did you see that turtle on the log? Look, it’s right there. No, there’s 
      actually two of them. Mom. Looooooook!”</p>

    <p>“I see them sweetie. That’s soooo cool!”</p>

    <p>After our paddle, we had dinner at a great restaurant at the end of the river. 
      Kyra sat next to Fred. I could tell Kyra was sizing him up deciding if she liked 
      him or not. She was teasing him and asking him a lot of questions.</p>

    <p>“Kyra, you keep that up and I just might have to bring out the tickle bug.”</p>

    <p>That did it. Kyra loved being tickled. It wasn’t too long before he had won her over.</p>

    <p>Early on in our relationship, I let Fred know about my mantra. I told him that 
      the most important thing for me in a relationship was to be loved, supported, 
      cherished, and adored. That’s what I was looking for and that’s what I needed 
      in a relationship. Above all else, that’s how I wanted to feel. Could he give 
      that to me? Was that something we could have together?</p>

    <p>Over the course of the next year and half, Fred has shown me how much he loves, 
      supports, cherishes and adores me. He fulfills my list.  And I am so grateful.</p>

    <p>In 2017, Fred and I got engaged.  We are planning our wedding in St. Augustine, 
      Florida in June 2018.</p>

    <p>He is the man of my dreams.</p>

    <p class="signature">I am LOVED.<br />
    I am SUPPORTED.<br />
    I am CHERISHED.<br />
    I am ADORED.</p>

    <p>I am getting married at 40!!!</p>

    <p>Pinch me!!!!</p>

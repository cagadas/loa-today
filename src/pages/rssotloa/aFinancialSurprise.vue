    <h5 class="h5 bottom0">A Financial Surprise</h5>
    <h6 class="h6">by Barbara Pinti</h6>

    <p>About a year ago, I began working with a woman who for many years had a poverty mentality.  
      Money was always short, and there was never enough to get to the things that weren’t 
      absolute necessities.</p>

    <p>She inherited a life script from her parents concerning money and honed that script to 
      perfection for 40 years.  She often talked about not having enough money for this or that.  
      She resented not being able to travel, her greatest desire.  She blamed everyone for her 
      living a life of lack rather than abundance.  Her words put forth a low vibration, and 
      that low vibration returned to her daily.</p>

    <p>I helped her write some affirmations about money while teaching her how it could come to 
      her easily by simply changing her beliefs.  We worked on raising her vibration by carefully 
      keeping her thoughts and words very positive.  She became more consciously aware of her 
      thoughts and her words whenever they became negative or discouraging.  I explained to her 
      that everything she desired was right there in the unseen world and only needed to be 
      claimed by her.</p>

    <p>I introduced her to visualizations.  I asked her to imagine herself and her family having 
      a wonderful time traveling to all the places she so wanted to experience.  She began to see 
      herself enjoying life with more than enough money to take those long desired adventures.</p>

    <p>This education about the Law of Attraction went on for about a month, and I did the exercises 
      with her.</p>

    <p>We examined the words of several famous people from Einstein who wrote, “Imagination is 
      everything,” to Buddha who wrote, “All that we are is the result of what we have thought.”</p>

    <p>Henry Ford informed us, “Whether you think you can or can’t … either way you are right.”</p>

    <p>Wayne Dyer added, “I will see it when I believe it.”</p>

    <p>We also studied the work of Masaru Emoto, who conducted many experiments with water showing 
      that the vibration of the words and thoughts connected to vials of water affected their 
      molecular structure in dramatic ways.  Knowing that both our planet and our bodies contain 
      approximately 70% water shows us how important it is to keep our vibrations high.</p>

    <p>After a few weeks of our working together to change her poverty script to raise her income, 
      she told me about a new job offered to her son that would take him to many interesting 
      places in Europe.  Her husband, who previously struggled with a low-paying, commission-only 
      job, also received a wonderful job offer from the same firm as her son and began making 
      much more money than before.  My client herself got back a former job that she loved, this 
      time with the hours and at the wage she asked for.  She later reported receiving a bonus 
      of over $2,000.</p>

    <p>That didn’t surprise me. What surprised me is that even though I wasn’t purposely intending 
      her exercises for myself, I began making more money than I ever had before!  My business 
      phone rang all the time, and my case load filled to capacity.</p>

    <p>This universal law knows not who you are or what it is you desire.  It just WORKS!</p>

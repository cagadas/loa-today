    <p>Help came when I was almost 24 years old.</p>

    <p>When I was 7, I was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes. By the time I was 21, 
      I started having problems with my eyesight. It didn’t come as a surprise. At 
      age 12 the doctors had already told me and my parents that I had symptoms that 
      would lead to future eye problems.</p>

    <p>I was diagnosed with retinopathy, a diabetes-related eye disease. In the years 
      that followed, I was treated with laser therapy many times. The results were not 
      successful.</p>

    <p>One day, when I was at the hospital again, I asked the doctor a simple and very 
      direct question: “Am I going blind?” His answer was: “Well, I cannot say that you 
      won’t go blind. I am sorry...”</p>

    <p>Now I wasn’t brought up religiously at all, and I don’t remember having ever 
      prayed before, but that night I prayed very hard and intensely for help! I remember 
      vividly while I cried that I prayed with the words, “I don’t care what I have to 
      do, if you want me to hang upside down here on this lamp, I will do it! Please, 
      please, please help me!”</p>

    <p>Help came a couple of months later. My aunt knew a homeopath whom she thought 
      could help me. So I went. My parents went with me the first time, very reluctantly 
      though. They had always been non-believers when it came to alternative practitioners. 
      Spirituality was not in their book and definitely shouldn’t be in mine either!</p>

    <p>My parents were very dominant, especially my father whom I had always been afraid of. 
      Even though I was 24 years old and not living at home anymore, they still believed 
      they could forbid me things. After that first visit to see the homeopath, I decided 
      to go again alone and didn’t tell them about it.</p>

    <p>On one of my visits, I told one of the employees working for the homeopath that 
      the doctors had said that the problems with my sight were irreversible. I could tell 
      she wanted to tell me something but felt hesitant. I encouraged her to tell me.</p>

    <p>She said she knew someone who could probably help me but that the woman was very 
      unconventional. I said that I didn’t care about “unconventional” and convinced her 
      to tell me more. Today I am so grateful that she did!</p>

    <p>The first time I went to see Marian, I remember walking in feeling as if my back 
      was pushed to the wall. When I saw her, I knew immediately that I had come to the 
      right place and person. I simply thought, “Okay, this is good.”</p>

    <p>As I learned about her methods, I became really interested in spiritual matters. 
      I also started to attend the courses she gave.</p>

    <p>The courses took place at her house, which is how I got to know her family as well. 
      With her husband Peet, she had two children a little younger than myself, Yosi and 
      Richard.</p>

    <p>The first time Marian told me about her son Richard, whom she was clearly very proud 
      of, I immediately felt a connection to him. I didn’t know why or how this was possible. 
      I had never met him and probably never would because he was studying in the U.S. at 
      the time. And obviously I had much bigger issues!</p>

    <p>One evening, just before the start of one of the evening classes, I had the following 
      conversation with Yosi.</p>

    <p>“I have been going to the library many times, looking for books on spiritual subjects. 
      As usual I really didn’t know what book to pick, so this time I decided to choose a 
      book in a different way. I made sure no one watched me.</p>

    <p>“I closed my eyes and touched the spines of the books with my fingertips. There were 
      approximately a hundred books to choose from, so it took some time, but at one point 
      my fingers started to tingle. So I chose that book, took it home, and started to read.”</p>

    <p>“And, was it good?” Yosi asked.</p>

    <p>“I couldn’t even finish the first page, simply because I just couldn’t stop crying. 
      It was a story of a young girl having spiritual experiences. For her, they were as 
      normal as breathing. Somehow it felt like it was my story. And my God! ... the 
      description of the landscape she grew up in!</p>

    <p>“That touched me even deeper. Apart from that I am intrigued by the way the regression 
      therapy is done at that institution the author talks about. So I read and cried and 
      read and cried and now I have decided I want to go there!”</p>

    <p>Yosi looked at me, amused, and asked me who the author was.</p>

    <p>“Chris Griscom,” I answered.</p>

    <p>The look on her face changed from amused to totally shocked and even a bit nervous.</p>

    <p>“What’s wrong,” I asked.</p>

    <p>“Are you sure?” she replied.</p>
    
    <p>“Well, yes, of course I am sure,” I said, not understanding her reaction.</p>

    <p>“Chris Griscom is the director and teacher at the school my brother is studying at, 
      in the United States.”</p>

    <p>Now it was my turn to be completely blown away. Yosi didn’t know that I so much 
      wanted to meet him. I couldn’t wrap my head around this so-called coincidence!</p>

    <p>Of all the dozens of books I could pick, I unknowingly chose the one that made me 
      decide to go to that awesome place in the U.S. not knowing that the one person I so 
      much wanted to meet was living and studying there.</p>

    <p>Yosi got up, and told her mom about it. Marian didn’t seem surprised and simply 
      said: “Well, I think some things are awaiting you there.”</p>

    <p>So here I was in September 1993, 26 years old, still studying, no job, no money, 
      determined to go to the Nizhoni School for Global Consciousness. Studying there 
      was not an option, but I learned they organized summer camps as well.</p>

    <p>The regression sessions described in the book and that I so much wanted to experience 
      were part of the program. I was not and am not a very patient person, so I decided 
      that next summer would be the right moment to go!</p>

    <p>Of course I knew I needed a lot of money that I didn’t have. The regression sessions 
      were pretty expensive, and I knew I had to save at least $6,000. I had no clue how to 
      do that. I just knew I wanted to.</p>

    <p>The next week a professor from Leiden University where I was studying Child Education 
      and Development asked me if I was interested in working for him for 16 hours per week.
      He was looking for someone who could help him with the book he was writing.</p>

    <p>The book was about a French pedagogue, and since I already had a master’s degree in 
      French he figured I would be the right choice. I started in October and thus made some 
      money … not enough to be able to go to the U.S., but it definitely was a start.</p>

    <p>What happened during the following months is still a mystery to me. For some reason 
      and in ways that I honestly cannot recall, I was able to save money. I “found” money 
      everywhere, and I saw opportunities everywhere to cut down on my regular expenses. It 
      became sort of an exciting game to me that I turned out to be very good at!</p>

    <p>I ran into Richard four times that same year. The first time wasn’t a coincidence. 
      I heard from Marian that her son would come home for two weeks. I knew that I wouldn’t 
      have a chance of meeting him unless I visited on an evening with no classes. Marian 
      had a lot of spiritual books. I asked her if it was okay for me to come over one 
      evening to take a look at her books to see if she had some that I might want to read. 
      Luckily, she agreed!</p>

    <p>It was typical Dutch winter weather, cold and rainy, so I put on something nice, 
      warm, and comfortable . I always wore glasses, but for this occasion I put in my 
      contacts. I felt prepared and ready to go. Still, I had no idea if he would actually 
      be at his parents’ home.</p>

    <p>As I came in, Marian immediately noticed I wasn’t wearing my glasses. I had a perfect 
      excuse: “Well, it’s dark and raining, and I suffer from night-blindness (which she knew 
      was true). I don’t see well with raindrops on my glasses.” She bought it.</p>

    <p>My preexisting feeling of connection was confirmed.  I fell in love with him. Actually, 
      that wasn’t accurate. A better word would be soulmate, someone I once knew.</p>

    <p>That same year, Chris Griscom came to the Netherlands to speak at a Congress organized 
      in Amsterdam. Of course I went with Yosi’s family. Richard was there too.</p>

    <p>That was the last time I saw him in the Netherlands. The next time would be at the 
      Nizhoni summer camp in 1997.</p>

    <p>I somehow had been able to save up $8,000 in nine months time! I still remember the 
      look on the face of the bank employee. I booked the camp and flight.</p>

    <p>She said, “Well, now you will have to pay $6,000.”</p>

    <p>Since I had saved the money all in cash, I simply took the $6,000 out of my pocket 
      and gave it to her. I remember wearing a red pair of trousers with huge pockets and 
      a long white sweater covering them. I figured no one would be able to see or least 
      of all expect me to have so much money on me.</p>

    <p>I didn’t know her thoughts, but I could tell she was surprised to say the least! 
      Now that I am older, I understand, but at the time I thought there was nothing 
      unusual or odd about it.</p>

    <p>So that is how I overcame the money hurdle, but there was yet another hurdle to clear 
      as well: my family. I had to tell them I was going to the U.S. alone to a 
      spiritually-oriented camp.</p>

    <p>They reacted the way I expected: upset, angry, scared, and dead set against my plans. 
      My father simply forbade me to go, even though I was 27 years old. He told me that if 
      anything went wrong I couldn’t count on the help of my family.</p>

    <p>My sister refused to talk to me all together.</p>

    <p>My brother didn’t understand why I had to go and what the hell I was going to do there.</p>

    <p>My mom agreed with my dad.</p>

    <p>I felt terrible. A week before my scheduled flight I took a long look in the mirror 
      and seriously imagined for about 30 seconds not going.</p>

    <p>I felt my energy drop drastically. The things around me and in the mirror lost their 
      colour. At that moment, I knew I wouldn’t be able to live with myself if I didn’t go.</p>

    <p>So I told my family my decision was final, and I went.</p>

    <p>I only have a few regrets in my life. One of the biggest, or probably THE biggest, 
      is that I didn’t get up when Richard showed up with a friend at the tent I stayed in 
      at Nizhoni Camp close to Santa Fe in New Mexico.</p>

    <p>I was lying on my stomach on the floor. I was still so ashamed of my body that I 
      didn’t dare to get up and walk over to him. I felt awful! I didn’t know what to do, 
      so I did nothing.</p>

    <p>Maybe that didn’t matter to him, but I felt and still feel deeply ashamed of not 
      getting up. I just said, “Hey, hi.”</p>

    <p>Even though he wasn’t the reason I went to the US, I really wanted to see him there. 
      He showed up, unannounced, and what did I do.…?</p>

    <p>“I told you there would be a Dutch girl here.”</p>

    <p>Those were the last words I ever heard him say and the last time I saw him.</p>

    <p>The Nizhoni camp was fantastic, and I never regretted going there for a second. 
      The environment was magical and “home” to me. I had great fun with the people I met 
      and learned a lot!</p>

    <p>In the regression sessions I discovered a lot about about myself and the role of 
      certain people in my life. I also understood why I had the absolute urge to come to 
      this part of the U.S. And yes, I also found out the reason I felt such a deep 
      connection to Richard.</p>

    <p>When I got back home after almost four weeks, I had trouble sleeping in a bed in 
      a house. In the U.S. I was part of a group that slept outside instead of in the 
      tent. I had slept outside on the ground for weeks, and I missed that. Once back 
      home, I tried sleeping on the balcony. It obviously wasn’t the same. No clear sky 
      filled with stars, no coyote sounds, just the city sounds. After a couple days of 
      this, I went to bed, my head and heart full of amazing experiences and blissful 
      memories. Today I am so grateful I had the opportunity to go and darn proud of 
      myself that I actually went.</p>

    <p>PS: My eyesight improved from 5 percent to 90 percent in one eye, and from 50 
      percent to a 100 percent in the other.</p>

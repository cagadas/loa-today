    <h5 class="h5 bottom0">Overcoming Five Devastating Losses</h5>
    <h6 class="h6">by Debra Oakland</h6>

    <p>In the span of four years, I lost my 21-year-old son, my unborn baby girl in 
      my eighth month of pregnancy, both brothers, and my father to prostate cancer.</p>

    <p>Those few, tragic years could have led to a dramatically worse outcome had I 
      not embraced my inner power, but I knew that the combined power of thought, 
      feeling, and action was required to build a strong inner foundation of courage.</p>

    <p>I look at life as my own personal, ever-changing movie reel. While some may 
      question how I could be writing my own script when there was so much sadness 
      in such a short period of time, I firmly believe we are where we are at any 
      given moment in time based upon an infinite and sequential series of choices 
      we make on our journey.</p>

    <p>The seemingly random events that occur are our cues to speak, to act, or to 
      respond. Which direction the scene takes is not based on the events occurring in 
      our lives but rather upon how we script our response.</p>

    <p>As the lead character in our own mental movie, we deliver our feelings, our 
      emotions, and our words while we direct our inner movie, sometimes with very 
      little editing but always in living color.</p>

    <p>My ultimate goal was to become the conscious director of my personal life movie, 
      rather than the reluctant supporting character.</p>

    <p>Let me share my story as a script with two different endings.</p>

    <hr />

    <p class="signature center">SCRIPT #1 – FADE IN</p>

    <p>My husband, Cody, answers a call from the hospital at five o’clock on a Sunday 
      morning. It is news a mother never expects to hear. There has been a car accident. 
      My son has died.</p>

    <p>First: disbelief. This can’t be happening! You never expect to lose a child before 
      your own life is complete. <em>Please God, make this go away.</em></p>

    <p>Shock sets in; indescribable pain permeates my entire being. I had been through so 
      much loss already. Now I have lost my only child and am heartbroken.</p>

    <p>In a state of shock, feeling disconnected and out of body, I have to decide how 
      to begin handling this news. Family is calling; people are trying to connect out 
      of concern and love.</p>

    <p>I want to sit and be still. No, that doesn’t feel good. I need to get up and move 
      around, go somewhere. No! That doesn’t work either. What to do, where to turn, how 
      to function?</p>

    <p>Cody is my rock, but he is in shock as well. How do we get through this loss? How 
      do I comfort us both? I can’t. Not now!</p>

    <p>Depression sets in, unable to function on any level; the days drag on to become 
      weeks, months, and years. Life has lost its luster. There seems to be no hope of 
      feeling normal again. Tears flow endlessly, guilt, self-pity, and hopelessness 
      become close friends.</p>

    <p>My marriage is lifeless, and I see no hope of it changing. My greatest fear is to 
      be hurt again by loving so deeply. Cody can no longer live in this sad and broken 
      marriage. As he takes his leave, he wishes it would have all turned out differently.</p>

    <p class="signature center">SCRIPT #2 – FADE IN</p>

    <p>My husband, Cody, answers a call from the hospital at five o’clock on a Sunday 
      morning. It is news a mother never expects to hear. There has been a car accident. 
      My son has died.</p>

    <p>First: disbelief. This can’t be happening! You never expect to lose a child before 
      your own life is complete. <em>Please God, make this go away.</em></p>

    <p>Shock sets in; indescribable pain permeates my entire being. I had been through 
      so much loss already. Now I have just lost my only child and am heartbroken.</p>

    <p>In a state of shock, feeling disconnected and out of body, I have to decide how 
      to begin handling this news. Family is calling; people are trying to connect out 
      of concern and love.</p>

    <p>I want to sit and be still. No, that doesn’t feel good. I need to get up and move 
      around, go somewhere. No! That doesn’t work either. What to do, where to turn, how 
      to function?</p>

    <p>Cody is my rock, but he is in shock as well. How do we get through this? I make a 
      conscious choice to find a way out of this despair. I must believe Love is greater 
      than even this situation. Cody and I decide to comfort each other as we talk about 
      how to get through this loss.</p>

    <p>I ask myself an important question: <em>What would my son, who loves me as I love 
      him, want most for me?</em></p>

    <p>I say to my husband, “Knowing the love we all carry for each other is on a deep 
      soul level, the only answer is that he would want us to live a happy life, celebrating 
      his life as a gift, grateful for the time we had together.”</p>

    <p>I choose to define my life by handling this loss with courage, strength, and peace. 
      My marriage to Cody grows stronger, and we become more resilient together.</p>

    <p>I realize there are different ways of responding to hardships and that we can change 
      our perspective from within. Both Cody and I rely on a strong foundation of inner 
      power that houses our courage and strength, knowing this is the way to celebrate and 
      honor our son’s life, to carry him in our hearts as a precious gift. I embrace life 
      with peace, gratitude, and compassion. I find the silver lining by going into the 
      world courageously and helping others through the process of loss and grief.</p>

    <hr />

    <p>This is my true story, and I am happy to report that Script #2 re-directed my life 
      in miraculous ways.</p>

    <p>After losing my son, something powerful awakened in me: courage, fearlessness, and 
      determination. I had nothing to lose. I needed to share my voice, and through writing 
      I found my silver lining.</p>

    <p>During the years that followed, I pursued various interests. I love photography, 
      so I took a class at a local college and learned to develop my own photos. I also 
      took art classes. Fashion has always been something I gravitate to. I collaborated 
      with a friend who owns a boutique and entered into the clothing business for 
      several years. Best of all, I was not afraid to step outside my comfort zone 
      any longer.</p>

    <p>I committed myself to my passionate purpose by showing up to write each day. Every 
      experience and challenge I went though led me back to my passion and was instrumental 
      to my growth, molding me into the woman I am today. It is a true joy to be living my 
      passion.</p>

    <p>Courage became a welcome companion as I pulled up my big girl boots and continued on 
      with my life, editing and rewriting my script as I went along. Every day as I sat down 
      to write, I said to myself, “I am the author of my life movie, I am unlimited, I am a 
      successful author with a powerful voice.”</p>

    <p>I later released my book, <em>Change Your Movie, Change Your Life: 7 Reel Concepts for 
      Courageous Change,</em> to the world.</p>

    <p>Had I continued with self-limiting beliefs, I would have never written my book, which 
    became a bestseller in the categories of happiness and personal transformation.</p>

    <p>It’s never too late to consciously choose to change the movie of your life. I have 
      connected with people around the world through my Living in Courage platform. Before 
      the loss I experienced, I was hesitant to use my voice, but no longer. I have been 
      invited to share my story on over 70 radio shows, podcasts, and videos. I have 
      collaborated on several books and support other inspirational writers.</p>

    <p>Gratitude fills my heart. We each have our own unique voice. My goal is to shine a 
      bright light into the world and to support others going through some of life’s biggest 
      challenges. What’s yours?</p>

    <p>Rather than dancing our life to the beat of other people, dance to the beat of your 
      own heart. When the Universe asks you to dance, say YES!</p>

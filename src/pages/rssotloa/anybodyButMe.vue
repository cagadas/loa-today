    <h6 class="h6">by Ruby Gangadharan</h6>

    <p>For as long as I could remember, I wanted more than anything 
      else in the world to be someone other than me. I lived, breathed 
      and dreamed of a time when I could stop being the person I was 
      and become someone else.</p>

    <p>This was me at age 12, and this intention stayed with me until 
      I finished college and started my first job. I am not entirely 
      sure of the exact moment it took hold. However, I do remember 
      being very aware of the conversations and experiences that helped 
      me to reach it, a mixture of what I was told, what I perceived, and 
      what explanations I was given.</p>

    <p>There were remarks that were directed towards me from my immediate 
      and extended family, from the teachers in school and our neighbors, 
      while others were more indirect like things I watched on television, 
      saw in movies, or heard between adults.</p>

    <p>At the heart of this was my list of “flaws”. There are too many to 
      list, but here are the few I remember because these had the greatest 
      impact on me.</p>

    <p>I wasn’t an early riser, so I was lazy.</p>

    <p>I was loud and vocal, so I wasn’t a decent girl.</p>

    <p>I didn’t like Math and numbers, so I wasn’t intelligent.</p>

    <p>I didn’t help with chores in the kitchen, so I would experience a hard life ahead.</p>

    <p>My skin was dark, I had a big belly, and I was short. So I was going to 
      create difficulties for my parents when the time was right. (Years later 
      I realized it meant marriage and finding a match.)</p>

    <p>I didn’t show a natural talent in the arts, so I was average and lacking.</p>

    <p>I was sure about what I liked and wanted, so I was stubborn and inflexible.</p>

    <p>I wore cheap hand-me-downs, so I was uncool and a lesser being.</p>

    <p>I asked for things that others my age had, so I was ungrateful and greedy.</p>

    <p>The other thing that shaped my intention was the confidence and happiness 
      I perceived in other people, either in real life or on television. My cousins 
      were so bold and articulate. My aunts were flawless in everything they did. 
      My school mates had all the answers.</p>

    <p>I also clearly remember being constantly asked to replicate all these actions 
      and behaviors.</p>

    <p>“Why can’t you do that?”</p>

    <p>“That’s what a good girl looks like.”</p>

    <p>“You should try this. It will make you more likable, successful, and popular.”</p>

    <p>The messages sank into my being until all I did was compare everything I 
      did with what I saw in others. I still struggle to recall an early memory of 
      being told what I was doing was good enough. It was always about the chase 
      of getting something else. Every achievement was overshadowed by what needed 
      fixing next.</p>

    <p>At 12 years old, I didn’t like my life, my body, my voice, my clothes, my people, 
      my circumstances, and everything else in-between. I lived the cliché, “The grass 
      is always greener on the other side.”</p>

    <p>I acted out this desire to be someone else and to fix my flaws. I hid my truth 
      and played a role, acting and pretending to be someone else. I learned how to 
      pretend and project strength and confidence. I learned what worked, what did not 
      work, and what would make me seem ... not me. It became my M.O.</p>

    <p>The pretense forced me to flex my curiosity muscle to read more, to investigate, 
      to ask questions, to try new things, to keep up the facade of “being anyone else 
      but me”.</p>

    <p>I hoped and wished for someone to give me a helping hand, a cool someone who would 
      validate who I was becoming. I believed that external validation is the only thing 
      that counts.</p>

    <p>I became alert and aware of people around me, noticing every individual that 
      crossed my path. I developed my communication skills and got good at reading the 
      room: faces, expressions, and everything between the lines. Soon, I could catch 
      every emotion that people knowingly or unknowingly communicated through words, 
      tone of voice, or physical actions. Eventually, I got so good at it that I kept 
      finding myself in a unique position to support others even before they knew they 
      needed it.</p>

    <p>In my mid 20’s, I was introduced to the literature of the Law of Attraction and 
      Yoga Sutras. I was so taken with everything I read, I decided I must dive in deeply. 
      I quit my job and decided to become a yoga teacher and a coach.</p>

    <p>I learned new practices and techniques on my spiritual journey. I read everything 
      I could get my hands on. I found discussion groups and started an introspection 
      that revealed what had been happening to me all my life. It was as if in one swift 
      stroke someone had articulated everything I had been feeling all these years.</p>

    <p>It was liberating. I finally understood myself through this literature, and I now 
      had the tools and a language to explain my experience.</p>

    <p>And that’s when it happened, quick as a blink. My wish, something that I was hoping 
      for since I was 12, had come true.</p>

    <p>I had become someone else!</p>

    <p>I was now a person who loved her life, body, voice, clothes, and the people I knew, 
      a person who was self-aware with the ability to self-correct.</p>

    <p class="signature">I WAS living the good life.<br />
      I WAS interesting and articulate.<br />
      I HAD the best deal with opportunities and people I trusted<br />
      I WAS living in greener pastures.<br />
      I WAS the person that had it made.<br />
      I HAD become the opposite of the old me in every way.</p>
    
    <p>In retrospect, I realize that the universe had heard the request of my 12-year-old 
      self to be anybody else but me. The change was not so much about who I was but more 
      about how I thought about who I was, about embracing all that I had and loving what 
      I could do with it.</p>

    <p>The Law of Attraction, the universal truth of creation, of action and subsequent 
      consequence, is always working. This is absolute and without exception. It is always 
      responding to our intentions and feelings.</p>

    <p>We don’t need to be anybody else but ourselves.</p>

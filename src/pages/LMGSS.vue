    <h5>Success</h5>

    <p>We increase the likelihood of our success by being ready and willing to be successful, and doing everything we can to start from a place of being well-prepared.</p>

    <p>If you have a desire for a relationship that could be described as a "soulmate" relationship, then I guarantee there are many soulmates out there for you. The purpose of this little guide is to help you set yourself up for soulmate success.</p>

    <p>It may sound very elementary to say that we need to be ready and willing to be successful, but remember, our “lizard brain”- the part of our brain that is very concerned about our survival &ndash; does not like change of any kind, even if that change is something better. </p>

    <p>Being ready and being willing are huge steps towards experiencing the relationship you know you desire.</p>

    <p>Here is the good news, by virtue of your being a human being, you are also a powerful creator. The ability to create our experience is the magic intrinsic in our humanity.</p>

    <p>We are always creating our reality, even when we are not aware of it. </p>

    <p>Our thoughts and feelings are comprised of vibrations, and they always attract a matching vibration.  This is sometimes referred to as the Law of Attraction.</p>

    <p>So, the first and foremost task in the quest for a soulmate relationship is being open, willing, and ready to be a soulmate yourself, and recognizing the magic within you to create this experience.</p>

    <p>First, let’s talk about the whole idea of soulmates, just to be sure that a soulmate relationship is what you are looking for.</p>

    <p>In the Holy Relationship, it's understood that we all have unhealed places, and that healing is the purpose of our being with another person. ~ Marianne Williamson</p>

    <h5>Anam Cara</h5>

    <p>One of the most beautiful pictures of soul connection I’ve heard is described in an ancient Celtic vow, called “Anam Cara”, which translates to “soul friendship”.</p>
    <p>"Anam Cara" was a meeting of two souls that was considered destiny, a sweet connection that served to awaken each to the soul's journey.</p>
    <p>The vow itself is incredibly beautiful. In fact, I think it would make a lovely wedding vow!</p>

    <p>◊◊◊</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 0">Anam Cara<br>
    I honor your path.<br>
    I drink from your well.<br>
    I bring an unprotected heart to our meeting-place.<br>
    I hold no cherished outcome.<br>
    I will not negotiate by withholding.<br>
    I am not subject to disappointment.</p>
    <p>◊◊◊</p>

    <p>The idea of a soul relationship that serves to awaken each party to their soul’s journey sounds romantic, and of course it is! However, we must also remember that our soul’s growth often comes in ways that can be uncomfortable as well.</p>
    <p>Your soulmate will be someone who has the privilege of enjoying incredible happiness with you, and also be there with you in times of stress and sorrow. </p>
    <p>All relationships experience growing pains and the stresses of life. Our soulmate relationships sometimes experience these in a deep way, but the stresses of life can also serve to make them stronger and deeper. There is a beautiful Swedish proverb that says, “shared joy is a doubled joy, shared sorrow is half a sorrow.” I think that describes a soulmate relationship in such a lovely way.</p>
    <p>I’ve heard it said that your soulmate is the one that can always “push all of your buttons”.  I’m not sure I would quite put it that way, but I will say that I believe the biggest, brightest mirrors we have are our most intimate relationships, and there is no relationship more intimate than a soulmate relationship.</p>
    <p>Note: Just because soulmate relationships will no doubt experience growing pains at times, this is due to the fact that when we are open to each other in a deep and intimate way we become vulnerable, and when we are vulnerable we can get hurt. The growing pains I’m speaking of have absolutely nothing to do with anything resembling abuse. Physical, emotional, and mental abuse are not factors in any healthy relationship. Your soulmate relationships, both platonic and romantic, will be built on mutual love, trust, and respect. </p>

    <p>Your desire for a deep and intimate soulmate relationship confirms that there are such souls desiring you, too!  It is always true that what you seek is seeking you. </p>

    <h5 id="magic">Magic</h5>

    <p>If you are my client or one of my group members or readers you'll already know what I mean by "magic".  My definition of magic is:</p>

    <p>The successful result of any conscious action taken to bring something from the metaphysical realm  (the realm of wishes, dreams, hopes, ideas, plans, brainstorms, etc.) into the material, physical realm (yes, everyday life!) having the hallmark of ease, grace, synchronicity and often an element of surprise and delight.</p>

    <p>That pretty much sums up what I want to be experiencing on a regular basis. </p>

    <p>Some people call it the Law of Attraction; I prefer to call it Conscious Creation or even better &ndash; Magic. The Law of Attraction is always occurring, but I like to be conscious about what I’m creating, and create it deliberately. That’s magic!</p>

    <p>And magic takes practice. Even if you know how something is done, it still takes much practice to achieve mastery. We can discuss all sorts of ideas, theories, and exercises, but until you begin actively practicing them daily you probably aren't going to see much in the way of results. </p>

    <p>So in this little guide I'm going to not only put forth ideas, but also encourage you to put them into practice immediately and consistently. I want you to get incredible results.</p>

    <h5>The Wedding Vows </h5>

    <p>A few years ago I was invited to a wedding. The wedding itself and the party that followed were incredibly lovely. A gorgeous bride, a handsome groom, adorable flower girls, beautiful flowers &ndash; the whole shebang. But there was something that made the wedding incredibly special to me &ndash; the groom was my client. Arriving at the wedding I felt like I was walking on air because my client and his beautiful bride were so very happy. </p>

    <p>But there was one little detail in this particular wedding that thrilled me. In fact, this one little twist excited me so much that I wrote a blog post about it when I got home from the reception, at 2:00am!</p>

    <p>The little twist that had my heart all aflutter was this: instead of the classic wedding vows that begin with something like "I, Marc Anthony, take you, Cleopatra..." these two lovebirds changed the vows to say, "I, Marc Anthony, receive you, Cleopatra..."</p>

    <p>Oh my. That is a stunning edit right there. And it spoke to me bigtime about those of us who want a soulmate relationship: We have to be open to receive one.</p>

    <p>So, my Lovely Magician, this is the very first thing that needs to be attended to if you are really and truly wanting a soulmate relationship. You must be open to receive one. </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h5>Being Open</h5>

    <p>How do you know if you are open or not?</p>

    <p>First, the fact that you are reading this little guide tells me that you are willing to be open. </p>

    <p>The hallmarks of a woman who is open are peace, happiness, trust in herself and trust in the Universe. She feels comfortable in her own skin. She is confident.</p>

    <p>When we are not open we tend to be defensive, worried, fearful and we find it very hard to trust.</p>

    <p>How do we become open? </p>

    <p>First, we choose to be.</p>

    <p>I know, that sounds really simple. But everything always begins with a choice, which starts with an intention, which starts with a desire. You are reading this because of your desire.</p>

    <p>You don't have to open up all at once. As you begin to love yourself you will begin to open.</p>

    <p>But before we talk about self-love...let's talk about trust a little bit.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="centerNoIndent"><a href="#top">Back To Top</a></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <hr id="trust"/>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h5>Trust</h5>

    <p>We've all had experiences that left a bitter taste in our mouth as far as feeling able to trust someone. </p>

    <p>We told someone our deepest secret and they shared it. </p>

    <p>We believed someone when they told us they'd be there for us and then they flaked out. </p>

    <p>We thought we knew someone and then we found out we didn't know them after all. </p>

    <p>These are common life lessons that most of us have learned. It always stings a bit to have our trust betrayed. But here are some things I've learned about trust… </p>

    <p>Trust is built over time. </p>

    <p>Trust begins with you trusting yourself.</p>
    
    <p>When we trust someone and our trust is betrayed we are not the ones who've done anything wrong. We mustn't blame ourselves, and it will do us a lot of good to forgive our self as well as the one who breached the trust. </p>

    <p>That doesn't mean that we are okay with it or that we have to give them a "second chance"...it just means that we don't hold unforgiveness in our hearts towards anyone.</p>

    <p>Forgiveness is for you. It takes the weight off you. You don't need to carry around unforgiveness. It blocks trust, love, and even abundance. It hinders our health. It causes endless stress. </p>

    <p>Remember, there are no mistakes, there is just human experience. Choose to know that you will always be there for yourself. Decide that you will always trust yourself. </p>

    <p>Choose to find a treasure in every experience &ndash; even the painful ones.</p>

    <p>Self-trust goes hand in hand with self-love, and self-love is the most important step to being ready for a soulmate relationship. In fact, until you really love yourself you won’t be able to have a satisfying intimate relationship.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h5>The Love Affair</h5>

    <p>"Most of us also want a fairy tale, but it never turns out that way does it? Because people are not perfect", she said.</p>

    <p>I listened as my client wondered aloud to me.  I was reminded of a question a reader emailed me that echoed a similar thought, "Does ‘true love’ really exist, or is it just a fairy tale?"</p>

    <p>Ah, the "fairy tale love affair". The one we all want. That perfect, shiny, sparkly, romantic relationship that suddenly makes our whole life easy and perfect, the one where the birds are chirping and the bees are singing and the flowers are blooming and the poisoned appl- WAIT! WHAT?  What poisoned apple?</p>

    <p>OH THAAAT poisoned apple.  Yes, the one in the, uh, fairy tale, ahem.  Along with the wicked witches, evil step sisters, malevolent queens, scary talking trees, flying monkeys and all manner of frightening villains and dangerous, fire-breathing circumstances.</p>

    <p>Those are the little details we seem to be forgetting when we fantasize and wish our own lives and loves were more like a fairy tale.  Within the confines of our imagination, within the covers of an enchanted book, it seems easier to remember and focus on the sparkly, shining deliciousness of dancing at midnight at the fairy ball and being swept off our feet by Prince Perfect.  How easily we forget the poisoned apples and flying monkeys. Life is full of experiences, some of them are uncomfortable. Even when we have found the most wonderful relationship possible, life still happens.</p>

    <p>Soulmates aren’t perfect, they’re real.  And soulmate relationships aren’t perfect, they’re real.  But they are, or they can be shiny, sparkly, and romantic.</p>

    <p>Your Prince, or Princess, (aka your Soulmate) won’t be perfect, but will be perfect for you. And even if the one you are with right now seems anything but perfect for you that can change. In fact, when we change, everything changes. I want to show you a few small changes that you can make that will create a world of difference, whether you are already in a relationship, or still looking for your soulmate.</p>

    <p>And, an important note: even though one of the magical parts of the fairy tale is often the idea of being rescued by Prince Perfect, you really only need rescuing if you are a victim.  </p>

    <p>And I know you don’t want to be a victim, right?</p>

    <p>Right?</p>

    <p>So how can we have the sparkly, shiny, dreamy romantic part?  When will it show up for us?</p>

    <p>When we learn how to love our self first.</p>

    <p>Loving our self is the first Love Affair that has to happen. We have to recognize that we are our own soulmate first. </p>

    <p>This is the single most important thing we can do to change our entire life experience for the better.</p>

    <p>We hear it so often that it’s become a cliché. “Love Yourself.” But so often we don’t know how to do it. </p>

    <p>It starts with intention. Loving intention. And commitment. </p>

    <p>If you can’t make a commitment to fully love and accept yourself it will be impossible for you to make that commitment to someone else. And because of the Law of Attraction, no one will be able to love you unconditionally and accept you as you are and fully commit to you if you can’t do that for yourself. The world can’t give you anything that you aren’t willing to give yourself. It’s just that simple.</p>

    <p>Decide today that you will make a loving intention and a strong commitment to love yourself fully and completely. Accept yourself just as you are. Choose to love every single thing about yourself with true unconditional love. </p>

    <p>You may want to employ a self-love mantra or affirmation, such as “I deeply love and accept myself just as I am.”</p>
    
    <p>Note: Self-love is not the same thing as self-care, so even if you are a pro at having "me time", and taking care of yourself with things like manicures and pedicures and massages and vitamins...are you doing these things with a loving intention? Or because you think you "should"?</p>

    <p>What about when you’re feeling down, or angry, or flustered – do you judge yourself for these feelings? Or do you love yourself through it? </p>

    <p>What about those critical thoughts that pop up? Do you listen to them?</p>

    <p>Those critical thoughts that accuse you of being lazy, or of spending too much money, or of not making enough money, or of being ugly, or fat, or too skinny, or…need I say more? The list of self-critical thoughts  and self-talk can be seemingly endless, especially in a world that encourages us to constantly compare ourselves to everyone else.</p>

    <p>Being critical of yourself or of anyone else is big red flag that your self-love is in need of some strengthening. We tend to criticize in others the hidden parts of ourselves that we consider unlovable.</p>

    <p>For the record, Lovely Magician, you are worthy of love and affection and abundance and joy and vibrant health and a soulmate and anything else you desire. Without changing one thing about yourself, you are worthy. It’s totally natural to want to improve ourselves and our relationships, to expand our horizons, create new things, up-level our life! But none of those things create your worth. You are already worthy of the best life has to offer. You are already worthy of great love.</p>

    <p>You can choose today to love everything you are – even the parts of you that you haven’t loved in the past. Love is an action, and a choice. </p>

    <p>I like to think of the way we bathe and dress a baby, we aren't expecting anything from them, and we do these daily caring tasks with a loving intention. No criticism, just pure love.</p>

    <p>Make a decision now that as often as you think of it, you'll give yourself care with a loving intention. Care for yourself with love, the way you might cuddle a pet, or water a favorite plant, or sing to a baby. </p>

    <p>Get a drink of pure water with an intention of self-love. Take yourself on a date to an art museum or for a walk in the park. Put on a special outfit or some good perfume as a ritual of love and adoration. </p>

    <p>Treat yourself like the princess in the fairytale.</p>

    <p>Mirror work is another very powerful way to work on our self-love. Look into the mirror, into your own eyes, and tell yourself "I love you. There is nothing too good for you." It might feel awkward at first, but soon it will become easier as your self-love grows and becomes stronger. </p>

    <p>This is a powerful way to let your subconscious know that you are worthy of love and of the best life has to offer!</p>

    <p>When we become willing to fall in love with our self, we are ready to begin being more open.</p>

    <p>We must be willing to see each other and ourselves through the magic mirror, the one that reflects our own shortcomings and flaws without judgment and lovingly supports us in bettering them. </p>

    <p>Our intimate relationships are the brightest mirror we have to show us where we are in the realm of self-love. </p>

    <p>Remember, the world cannot give us anything we aren't willing to give our self.</p>

    <p>When we decide to love our self it will be easy to create strong boundaries and stop accepting poisoned apples! </p>

    <p>When we love our self we won't accept invitations to drama or conflict. And we will never tolerate physical, verbal, or emotional abuse.</p>

    <p>There may be some scary talking trees and flying monkeys in our life journey, and we can decide that we will focus on the good, the loving, the eternal. </p>

    <p>The elements along the way that are uncomfortable are there to help us learn love and compassion, to help us recognize the wounds that need healing (if we didn't have wounds we'd never get triggered!), to help us support each other in growing and reaching our full potential. </p>

    <p>Real relationships are not perfect, they are real!</p>

    <p>We don’t need rescuing.</p>

    <p>We can choose to make decisions based on love, instead of fear.</p>

    <p>When we enjoy each moment and experience life fully, knowing that the power of love exists right now, in this present moment, we will experience magic.</p>

    <p>When we live in this way, we will recognize that true love is real, and soulmates exist here in our present reality and not in a fairy tale.</p>

    <hr id="open-heart"/>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h5>An Open Heart</h5>

    <p>Living with an open heart requires vulnerability. And yet we often deny our vulnerability because we don’t want to get hurt. We may develop a hard shell or put an energetic wall up because we are attempting to avoid heartbreak, hurt feelings, or disappointment.</p>

    <p>I want to share a personal story with you because I think it will be helpful, especially if you have closed up because of a bad relationship experience or a broken heart. </p>

    <p>I was involved in an emotionally abusive relationship for more than two decades. I have some pretty serious experience with being hurt &ndash; deeply, and consistently. </p>

    <p>My experience also extends to making myself nearly invulnerable. I put on a hard shell (with a soft smile &ndash; no one needed to actually see that I was putting up a wall of defense). </p>

    <p>I decided that I wouldn’t let myself be hurt, I would be strong, invincible. I would NOT be vulnerable. Looking back, I realize that this seemed to make the pain even worse. The excruciating pain of wanting a healthy relationship so badly, and not seeing any way it would ever happen.</p>

    <p>Eventually, my marriage ended in a nasty divorce, and my own decision to not allow myself to be vulnerable kept me from seeking the support I so desperately needed. </p>

    <p>My best friend didn't even know how bad my marriage had been!</p>

    <p>I didn't want to appear weak, or out of control, so I put on a smile and just pretended everything was fine, even though it wasn't.</p>

    <p>It was painful.  I finally did reach out for support from my wonderful group of friends and family, I did A LOT of personal growth work, I learned how to truly and deeply love myself, and I did finally heal from the pain. It took time. More than 2 years.</p>

    <p>And after I healed is where my story becomes really useful in answering this question I got from a reader: </p>

    <p>"How do I keep the sensitivity and vulnerability of my spirit, without feeling hurt all of the time?"</p>

    <p>As I healed I began to blossom. I opened. I began to really, truly, LOVE my life. I began to really, truly LOVE myself. I felt so alive and so happy. I was living with intention, being authentic, and it felt magical. I had found my path, knew my purpose, and was amazed at how beautiful my life was becoming every single day.</p>

    <p>I felt whole, and because of that I felt I was ready for a relationship. An awesome relationship, of course, and this time I knew what that really meant &ndash; a soulmate relationship full of love, passion, laughter, and mutual respect.</p>

    <p>I met a wonderful man. I fell in love. Everything was completely magical. And then it happened. We had a small disagreement. I cried. We made up. I was okay.  </p>

    <p>The world didn’t end.  </p>

    <p>And then a few weeks later I got hurt again. This time there was NO reasonable or logical excuse for it, it was a total misunderstanding. I KNEW I was "making a mountain out of a molehill" but there it was, I felt wounded. It was a small thing. In fact, it was something that wouldn’t even have bothered most people and yet something got triggered in me and there I was feeling completely torn up about it. Feeling so hurt over something so stupid then had me questioning everything! </p>

    <p>"Why am I suddenly being totally petty?" I was asking myself. This reaction was so unlike anyone I wanted to be. I honestly questioned whether I could do this ‘relationship thing’. (Not a comfortable question to be asking yourself when you are a relationship coach!)</p>

    <p>I was wondering "WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?!"</p>

    <p>I remember it like it was yesterday. I was standing in my closet, hanging up a sweater and feeling so frustrated about my own emotions, asking myself WHY was I so sensitive? I felt so vulnerable...uh oh.</p>

    <p>Then it hit me. This vulnerability that was allowing me to feel heartache was the very same vulnerability that was allowing me to feel so open, so seen, so heard, so loved, so connected.</p>

    <p>And MY vulnerability and sensitivity were also the very things that allowed my Sweetheart to be open to me, to be honest and real and authentic and vulnerable with me. I remember the epiphany-like realization that I needed to decide now whether it was worth it, because I knew I could not have one without the other.</p>

    <p>Was the risk of a broken heart worth the magic of true love?</p>

    <p>Was feeling hurt over an occasional misunderstanding worth feeling the thrill of deep, pure connection?</p>

    <p>Was I willing to be open to being triggered so that my own soul, my own wounds, could be healed?</p>

    <p>Was this wide open heart that was totally vulnerable and unprotected worth the rapture of having a soulmate relationship?</p>

    <p>My answer was, and is, an unequivocal YES.</p>

    <p>Misunderstandings and miscommunications are inevitable in relationship, especially a brand new relationship. </p>

    <p>These things happen because we don’t yet know each other well, and they are the very things that enable us to know each other better. These experiences are the very things that give us practice in responding in a conscious way, in Being who we want to Be.  </p>

    <p>Our intimate relationships are the clearest mirror we have to show us who we are, and sometimes it feels uncomfortable, sometimes it can hurt.</p>

    <p>But these things are also the place where we both can grow into our full potential...as friends, as lovers, as soulmates, and human beings.</p>

    <p>You do not have to feel hurt all of the time. You can certainly allow yourself to open, to be vulnerable, to be sensitive and to allow those qualities to support you in connecting, in loving yourself and others, and in becoming stronger emotionally.</p>

    <p>If you are in a place where you are feeling hurt all of the time it’s time to figure out why. Basically when we feel hurt (or any other uncomfortable unwanted feeling or emotion) it is because we have a need that is not being met.</p>

    <p>Vulnerability and the kind of growth we experience in a soulmate relationship can be uncomfortable. However, loving relationships contain mutual respect and are not abusive in any way. </p>

    <p>Abusive behavior is never acceptable. Abuse is always the poison apple in a relationship. Your self-love and self-respect will always say "NO" to abuse. </p>

    <p>Staying in an abusive relationship is a very big red flag that you are not loving yourself. You cannot be showing yourself love and allowing yourself to be abused at the same time.</p>

    <p>If you are experiencing pain in your current relationship or in your life it is because there is a need you have that is not being met. Making sure that you are getting your needs met is what self-love is all about. And remember, you don't need a certain person to do a certain thing to meet your needs...your needs are your responsibility. And taking responsibility for your own happiness is the most powerful thing you can do as a conscious creator. </p>

    <p>Pay attention to your feelings. Your feelings are a miracle. All of them. They are there to guide you into the fullest most joyful expression of your unique path and purpose.</p>

    <h5>Safety &amp; Self-love</h5>

    <p>A few years ago I recognized a trending theme in some of my coaching sessions one week, the desire to feel safe.  The common denominators: Each client that communicated this desire was a woman, and all of them were referring to relationships with men.</p>

    <p>I believe that one of the most important (if not THE most important) relationship ingredient for a woman is safety.  When I speak of safety I speak of physical safety, of course, and also emotionally safety, and sexual safety. </p>

    <p>As a relationship coach I hear this desire for safety expressed often, and as a woman I can relate to and understand this need.</p>

    <p>One evening I was out riding my bike, and reflecting on my day.</p>

    <p>As I was riding and thinking about the common thread throughout these recent coaching sessions I noticed a beautiful college age woman riding her bicycle around the lakes. She was not wearing a helmet.</p>

    <p>Cyclists without helmets... something I see too often. My thoughts then turned to the drivers I see that are texting while driving and talking on cell phones while driving, once I even saw someone working on a laptop while driving! All unsafe activities that, unfortunately, people engage in all too frequently.</p>

    <p>That is when these two trains of thought collided and merged into another thought; People often live out an identity that is not in alignment with their desire.</p>

    <p>In this example, how can I expect to feel "safe" in a relationship if I am consistently putting out a message to the Universe that safety isn't really one of my primary concerns?</p>

    <p>The world around us is a mirror that reflects exactly what is going on inside of us. Our life experience is always directly related to our identity. </p>

    <p>When what we say we want isn't showing up, the clue we're looking for can first be found within, and it shows up in our outside experience in our relationships with other people and things.</p>

    <p>Our outer experience is a mirror of our level of self-love. When we decide to start loving our self fully everything in our outer experience changes for the better, including our relationships, of course.</p>

    <h5>The List</h5>

    <p>Some teachers and coaches will encourage you to make a list of what it is you want in a soulmate. I’m a fan of this idea for one simple reason – you can’t have what you want if you don’t know what it is!</p>

    <p>However, I believe that we also need to know what we don’t want, and be able to say no if it shows up. I’m not talking about being overly persnickety about every little detail about someone. I am talking about the desires, and the deal-breakers.</p>

    <p>Love yourself enough to find out what it is you desire in a relationship, and then love yourself enough to allow it in!</p>
